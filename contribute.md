# How to Contribute to This OpenSoundControl website

The creators of this website ask OSC users and developers worldwide to
contribute various kinds of content to the site (under the site's
CC-BY [license](license.html)). 

The easiest way to contribute something is to fill out one of these
web forms:

* [Implementation](https://forms.gle/fPnM82RxS1hBNPua8): hardware or
  software that sends and/or receives OSC and could be useful to
  other people.
* [Publication](): a journal article, conference paper, technical
  report, etc., describing research related to (implementing, using,
  teaching, extending...) OSC.
* Best practice
* Project using OSC
* Address space / schema that other people may like to copy or know about
* Simple boilerplate template code that can be a starting point for OSC sending/receiving in various languages
* Suggested edit/correction/update to an existing page on the site.
* ...

Site editors will manually review form submissions and approve all
legitimate additions to the site. The result of approved submissions is
a [TSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values) file whose
rows are the various submitted items and whose columns are the fields
for that type of item; a script automatically generates site pages from
the TSV files.

All site content lives in this git repo:
<https://github.com/CNMAT/OpenSoundControl.org>
