 Mapping nonmusical data to sound
</h2>
<div class="content">
 <p>
  This is almost the same as the "Sensor/Gesture-Based Electronic Musical Instruments" application area above, except that the intended user isn't necessarily a musician (though the end result may be intended to be musical). Therefore the focus tends to be more on fun and experimentation rather than musical expression, and the user often interacts directly with the computer's user interface instead of special musical controllers

    Sodaconstructor
   </a>
   is software for building, simulating, and manipulating mass/spring models with gravity, friction, stiffness, etc. Parameters of the real-time state of the model (e.g., locations of particular masses) can be mapped to OSC messages for control of sound synthesis.

    SpinOSC
   </a>
   is software for building models of spinning objects. Properties such as size, rotation speed, etc. can be sent as OSC messages.

   ’s Circular Optical Object Locator (Hankins et al. 2002) is based on a rotating platter upon which users place opaque objects. A digital video camera observes the platter and custom image-processing software outputs data based on the speed of rotation, the positions of the objects, etc. A separate computer running Max/MSP receives this information via OSC and synthesizes sound.

   is a message-centric communication framework for advanced pseudo-realtime sonic and visual content generation, built with OSC. Clients register with a central multiplexing server to subscribe to particular data streams or to broadcast their own data.
