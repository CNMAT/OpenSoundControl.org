## Networked LAN Musical Performance

::: {.content}
A group of musicians operate a group of computers that are connected on
a LAN. Each computer is somewhat independent (e.g., it produces sound in
response to local input) yet the computers control each other in some
ways (e.g., by sharing a global tempo clock or by controlling some of
each others\' parameters.) This is somewhat analogous to multi-player
gaming.\

*Each player can control some of the parameters of every other player*\
\
Examples:

-   At ICMC 2000 in Berlin ( <http://www.audiosynth.com/icmc2k> ), a
    network of about 12 Macintoshes running SuperCollider synthesized
    sound and changed each others' parameters via OSC, inspired by David
    Tudor's composition \"Rainforest.\"
-   The Meta-Orchestra project (Impett and Bongers, 2001) is a large
    local-area network that uses OSC.
-   [Simulus](http://listen.to/simulus) use OSC over WiFi to synchronise
    clock and tempo information between
    [SuperCollider](http://www.audiosynth.com/) and
    [AudioMulch](http://www.audiomulch.com/) in their live performances.
    See (Bencina, 2003) for a discussion of MIDI clock synchronisation
    techniques which have since been applied to OSC.
