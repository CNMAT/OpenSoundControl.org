## Description

SwingOSC is intended as a compact java(tm)-reflection/beans and swing based GUI server, but can be used in a more general fashion to control java classes through OSC. <p> SwingOSC uses either UDP or TCP network protocols. Java classes can be dynamically added to the classpath at runtime, therefore it is also a useful tool to add OSC functionality to any kind of java application. <p> SwingOSC includes a set of GUI classes for SuperCollider that bring the common functionality known from the Mac OS only Cocoa classes to other platforms. It includes a proof-of-concept example for Pure Data.
