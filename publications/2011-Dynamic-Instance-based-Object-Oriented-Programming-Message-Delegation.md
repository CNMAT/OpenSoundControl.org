**Abstract**:  A new media programming style is introduced that brings efficient run-time polymorphism, functional and instance-based object-oriented programming to Max/MSP and related visual dataflow languages. Examples are presented to illustrate new, unusual and effective applications of the approach of using OSC messages for object representations and data flow for method delegation. 

**Context**: Adrian Freed kindly provided a parseable collection of OSC-related papers from his website, ported to the new site by Matt Wright in May 2021
