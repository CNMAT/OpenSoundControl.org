  This work is a re-implementation and (hopefully) modernization of the the classic OSC-Kit, which was originally provided by Matt-Wright and was written in pure C (see http://www.cnmat.berkeley.edu/OpenSoundControl).
  <br>
  Matt's kit uses lots of global variables, a fast but user-unfriendly memory-allocation (and de-allocation)-scheme, makes use of non type-save osc-callback-functions, has no real exception handling and its modularity is heavily restricted due to the C-design. There is also no documentation based on a modern auto-doc-system (e.g. doxygen) what makes it harder for newbies to get an OSC-system running in 10 minutes since they have to read all (or at least some) source-files first.
 </p>
 <p>
  Summary of the reasons of the re-implementation are:
 </p>
 <p>
  Higher level programming language (C++) and therefor a higher productivity.
  <br>
  Enhanced modularity.
  <br>
  Enhanced code-reusage.
  <br>
  Elimination of global variables and functions to facilitate usage of multiple OSC-servers in the same process.
  <br>
  Good exception handling.
  <br>
  Type-save interfaces for OSC arguments in OSC-methods.
  <br>
  Better (and dynamic) management of OSC-methods.
  <br>
  Good documentation.
  <br>
  Less complex OSC-system implementation.
