**Abstract**:  We present work on the “o.io” system, a suite of tools for hiding vendor-specific and protocol- specific details of con-trollers and actuators and for replacing diffuse documentation and heterogeneous ontologies with harmonized, situational schema carried along in real-time with gesture and actuator control values as Open Sound Control (OSC) bundles. We introduce useful general design patterns and object-oriented tools that support them. We conclude with details of support of two particular devices that illustrate the potential of “o.io”, the QuNeo and Bluetooth LE heart rate monitors. 

**Context**: Adrian Freed kindly provided a parseable collection of OSC-related papers from his website, ported to the new site by Matt Wright in May 2021
