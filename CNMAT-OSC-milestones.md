# CNMAT OSC Milestones

Quasi-timeline linking to some of the ideas and research leading to the development of OSC.

1989-??? Buchla Thunder.  David Wessel's composition / improvisation /
instrument-design process was centered around the Thunder in these
years.

1990-1993: [NeXT Cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXTcube) had musical applications.

1993-97 [SGI Indy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SGI_Indy) could
synthesise hundreds of additive synthesis partials in real-time on the
main CPU.

Adrian Freed's softcast additive synthesizer ran on Indy CPU and could
synthesize hundreds of partials in realtime:

1996 SynthControl “protocol” to control softcast:

1997 CAST OSC Implementation:

1998 revised CAST OSC implementation: <https://web.archive.org/web/20001007052955/http://cnmat.cnmat.berkeley.edu/CAST/Server/CAST-OSC-implementation.html>

In particular OSC could control the “transforms” of the spectral models (aka “timbral prototypes”)

- Timbral prototypes (interpolating multiple SDIF files): <https://web.archive.org/web/20001011081643/http://cnmat.cnmat.berkeley.edu/CAST/Server/timbralprotos.html>

- transpose: <https://web.archive.org/web/20001007220950/http://cnmat.cnmat.berkeley.edu/CAST/Server/transpose.html>

- inharmonicity: <https://web.archive.org/web/20001007143533/http://cnmat.cnmat.berkeley.edu/CAST/Server/inharm.html>


CAST release 1.13 used OSC:  <https://web.archive.org/web/20001008224123/http://cnmat.cnmat.berkeley.edu/CAST/releases.html>

2002 Spec: <spec-1_0.html>


To do sinusoidal analysis/synthesis today you could try Michael Klingbeil's
SPEAR (sound file to SDIF file): <http://www.klingbeil.com/spear>
