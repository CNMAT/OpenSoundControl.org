# The Git Repository Behind this Website

One way this website is "open" is that all the source files that
contain and create the site content are in a world-readable git
repository:

**<https://github.com/CNMAT/OpenSoundControl.org>**

Therefore you can:

- Clone the site for yourself to download and examine all the files.
- Browse the content of the site within github's website.
- [Contribute](contribute.html) to the site via a pull request (if you
  know what you're doing).
- Keep your own copy or mirror of the site content.
