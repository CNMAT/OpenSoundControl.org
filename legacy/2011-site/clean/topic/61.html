  Wacom digitizing graphic tablets are attractive gestural interfaces for
real-time computer music. They provide extremely accurate two-dimensional
absolute position sensing of a stylus, along with measurements of pressure,
two-dimensional tilt, and the state of the switches on the side of the stylus,
with reasonably low latency.  The styli (pens) are two-sided, with a
"tip" and an "eraser." The tablets also support other
devices, including a mouse-like "puck," and can be used with two
devices simultaneously.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unfortunately, 
this measurement data comes from the Wacom drivers in an inconvenient form. Each 
of the five continuous parameters is available independently, but another parameter, 
the "device type," indicates what kind of device is being used and, 
for the case of pens, whether the tip or eraser is being used. For a program to 
have different behavior based on which end of the pen is used, there must be a 
switching and gating mechanism to route the continuous parameters to the correct 
processing based on the "device type." Similarly, the tablet senses 
position and tilt even when the pen is not touching the tablet, so a program that 
behaves differently based on whether or not the pen is touching the tablet must 
examine another variable to properly dispatch the continuous parameters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of simply providing the raw data from the Wacom drivers, our
  <b>
   Wacom-OSC
  </b>
  object outputs OSC messages with different addresses for the
different states.  For example, if the eraser end of the pen is currently
touching the tablet,
  <b>
   Wacom-OSC
  </b>
  continuously outputs messages whose
address is
  <font face="Courier" size="2">
   /eraser/drawing
  </font>
  and whose arguments are the current values of position, tilt, and pressure.
At the moment the eraser end of the pen is released from the tablet,
  <b>
   Wacom-OSC
  </b>
  outputs the message
  <font face="Courier" size="2">
   /eraser/release
  </font>
  .  As long as the
eraser is within range of the tablet surface,
  <b>
   Wacom-OSC
  </b>
  continuously
outputs messages with the address
  <font face="Courier" size="2">
   /eraser/hovering
  </font>
  and the same
position, tilt, and pressure arguments.
 </p>
 <p>
  With this scheme, all of the dispatching on the "device type"
variables is done once and for all inside
  <b>
   Wacom-OSC
  </b>
  , and hidden from
the interface designer. The interface designer simply uses the existing
mechanisms for routing OSC messages to map the different pen states to
different musical behaviors.
 </p>
 <p>
  We use another level of OSC addressing to define 
distinct behaviors for different regions of the tablet. The interface designer 
creates a data structure giving the names and locations of any number of regions 
on the tablet surface. An object called
  <b>
   Wacom-Regions
  </b>
  takes the OSC messages 
from
  <b>
   Wacom-OSC
  </b>
  and prepends the appropriate region name for events that 
occur in the region.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, suppose the pen is drawing within a region named
"foo."
  <b>
   Wacom-OSC
  </b>
  outputs the message
  <font face="Courier" size="2">
   /tip/drawing
  </font>
  with
arguments giving the current pen position, tilt, and pressure.
  <b>
   Wacom-Regions
  </b>
  looks up this current pen position in the data structure
of all the regions and sees that the pen is currently in region
"foo," so it outputs the message
  <font face="Courier" size="2">
   /foo/tip/drawing
  </font>
  with the same arguments. Now the standard OSC message routing mechanisms can
dispatch these messages to the part of the program that implements the
behavior of the region "foo."
 </p>
 <p>
  Once again tedious programming work is hidden from the interface designer,
whose job is simply to take OSC messages describing tablet gestures and map
them to musical control.
