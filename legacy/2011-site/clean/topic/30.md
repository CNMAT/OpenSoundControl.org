For those interested in the gory details: this site was developed by
Andrew W. Schmeder and Adrian Freed using the drupal content management
system.

We picked drupal because of its flexibility and especially its strong
support for the collaborative workflow that we need to support the
working group activity. An example of this is the drupal implementation
of \"wikis\" ( \"Books\" in drupal terminology). With drupal any content
such as a forum post can be integrated directly into books.
