**Abstract**:  Standard laptop computers are now capable of sizeable quantities of sound synthesis and sound processing, but low-latency, high quality, multichannel audio I/O has not been possible without a cumbersome external card cage.  CNMAT has developed a solution using the ubiquitous 100BaseT Ethernet that supports up to 10 channels of 24-bit audio, 64 channels of sample-synchronous control-rate gesture data, and 4 precisely time-stamped MIDI I/O streams. Latency measurements show that we can get signals into and back out of Max/MSP in under 7 milliseconds.   The central component in the device is a field programmable gate array (FPGA).   In addition to providing a variety of computer interface capabilities, the device can function as a cross-coder for a variety of protocols including GMICS.  This paper outlines the motivation, design, and implementation of the connectivity processor. 

**Context**: Adrian Freed kindly provided a parseable collection of OSC-related papers from his website, ported to the new site by Matt Wright in May 2021
