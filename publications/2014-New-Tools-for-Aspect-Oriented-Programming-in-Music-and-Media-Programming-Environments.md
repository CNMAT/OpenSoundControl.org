**Abstract**: Media/arts programming is often experimental and exploratory in nature and requires a flexible development environment to enable continually changing requirements and to facilitate iterative design in which the development of software impacts the design of a work of art which in turn produces new requirements for the software. We discuss agile development as it relates to media/arts programming and present aspect-oriented programming and its implementation in Max/MSP using Open Sound Control and the odot library as tool for mobilizing the benefits of agile development.
