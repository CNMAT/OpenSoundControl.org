# The Original OpenSoundControl.org Website

Much of the content of this current OpenSoundControl.org website came
from the original Drupal-4-based OpenSoundControl.org website set up
by Adrian Freed in 2004 (initially for the [2004 OpenSoundControl
Conference](2004-osc-conference.html)) and updated until about 2011.

In 2021 Matt Wright scraped this content from the "[last archive.org
version](https://web.archive.org/web/20201128050430/http://opensoundcontrol.org/)"
of the site and reformatted it into new site content using a
collection of kludgy bash scripts in the repository. Matt, Jeremy
Wagner, and Hallie Smith then confirmed all this information .

All site content marked "legacy" came from the above process.

(Another source of legacy information is the [Archive of the UCSB
Create OSC developer mailing
list](https://osc-dev.create.ucsb.narkive.com), which closed in 2017.)
