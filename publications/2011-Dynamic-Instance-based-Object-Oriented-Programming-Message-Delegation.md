**Abstract**:  A new media programming style is introduced thatbrings efficient run-time polymorphism, functional andinstance-based object-oriented programming toMax/MSP and related visual dataflow languages.Examples are presented to illustrate new, unusual andeffective applications of the approach of using OSCmessages for object representations and data flow formethod delegation. 

**Context**: Adrian Freed kindly provided a parseable collection of OSC-related papers from his website, ported to the new site by Matt Wright in May 2021
