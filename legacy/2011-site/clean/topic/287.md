I\'m using OSC\_writeAddress() followed by OSC\_writeIntArg() to send
OSC buffers from iPhone to max, 1 packet at a time. my range of values
goes from 0 - 320. this works for integers 0 - 53, 74 - 127, 197 - 309
inclusive but all other values that i try to send arrive at max as
0.000000.

i can\'t seem to get float args decoded properly at all on the max side
and using writeAddressAndTypes doesn\'t work either.

Does anybody know where these 0\'s are coming from??

Thanks.
