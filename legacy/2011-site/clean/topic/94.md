Hello Everybody, I\'am new to audio processing and it is very wonderful
what is possible to do with osc and Max.

I have to write an application in java that send control to a max/msp
application, I downlaod the osc and configure everything but I don\'t
understand the message specification, When ever I send a message I
receive this message from java to msp ().

net.recv.udp: OSC Bad message name string: DataAfterAlignedString:
Unreasonably long string\
Dropping entire message.

Can anyone help me???

I attach the msp file as image.
