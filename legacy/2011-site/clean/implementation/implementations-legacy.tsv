CNMAT has developed a solution using the ubiquitous 100BaseT Ethernet that supports up to 10 channels of 24-bit audio, 64 channels of sample-synchronous control-rate gesture data, and 4 precisely time-stamped MIDI I/O streams. Latency measurements show that we can get signals into and back out of Max/MSP in under 7 milliseconds. The central component in the device is a field programmable gate array (FPGA). In addition to providing a variety of computer interface capabilities, the device can function as a cross-coder for a variety of protocols including GMICS. This paper outlines the motivation, design, and implementation of the connectivity processor.

First, RF transmissions are regulated by local FCC and it\'s pretty difficult to find radio channels available and authorized worldwide. Second, sharing a single radio carrier requires a good and robust protocol to avoid collision of information. [IEEE 802.11](http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/802/11) standard was designed for this purpose with a CSMA/CA (collision avoidance) mechanism and statistic delays before transmitting to autoregulate traffic and probability of being able to transmit when you need to.  <p>  The challenge was to make a WiFi pocket size digitizer, not base on a tiny linux board, but designed from scratch in order to be as close as possible from the hardware (an of-the-shelf CompactFlash 802.11b card) and an optimised UDP/IP stack. 802.11 is actually \"only\" a transportation layer for 802.3 (Ethernet) : OSC was then just as close as it can be.  <p>  The basic implementation of OSC is like the one of the Ethersense Project.\ **/WBxx \[16 int list\]** 		Packet Construction	i: int32			UDP			Unknown	Feb 23, 2021	Unknown
