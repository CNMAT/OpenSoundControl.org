## osctools.sourceforge.net

::: {.content}
hi,

I\'ve created a project on sourceforge called
[**osctools**](http://osctools.sourceforge.net/) in order to hold the
sourcecode for various programs and libraries i\'ve started to work on
after the [OSC developper meeting at
NIME06](http://www.opensoundcontrol.org/group_book/developers/nime06meeting)
.\
The hot topics are about using Bonjour/ZeroConf, automatic namespace
discovery, queries, standardized schemas\...\
For now the code mainly demonstrate how to use Zeroconf/Bonjour in order
to advertise and browse for OSC applications.

there\'s the code for

-   **oscbonjour** : a max/msp external doing the registering, browsing,
    resolving
-   **OSCBrowser** : that list all services of type \"\_osc.\_udp\", but
    that should also display the namespace of the application, once
    automatic namespace discovery works
-   **OSCCommandLine** : the start of a command line tool similar to the
    way the ftp program works, i.e. you have an osc prompt \"osc\>\" and
    you can type commands to be executed like connect, send, browse,
    register\...
-   **zeroconf** : C++ classes around the dns-sd API dedicated to ease
    programming with Bonjour, these are designed to be similar to the
    [oscpack](http://www.audiomulch.com/~rossb/code/oscpack/) library by
    Ross Bencina

the code is available via subversion like that:\
`    svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/osctools/trunk osctools   `

or you can browse it on-line here:\
<http://svn.sourceforge.net/osctools>

anyone wanting to join-in and contribute, please let me know an give me
your sourceforge details so that I can add you to the project.
