Hello everybody!\
I\'m trying to implement OSC in a software that was written with Visual
C++ 6.0. All efforts to convert this project to a newer Version of
Visual Studio didn\'t work out. So im stuck to Visual Studio 6.0.\
My problem is, that I don\'t find a OSC libary that I can implement in
my VC++6.0 Project. I tryed it with WoscLib and with oscpack. I was able
to build both of them as described in there readame\'s with MinGW but
(maybe ofcourse) not with VC++6.0.\
Is there anything I\'ve missed or did wrong? Does anybody know how it
could work?\
If you need more information, just tell me!

Thank you for your help!\
Jo
