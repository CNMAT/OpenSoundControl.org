**Abstract**:  This paper addresses the problem that most electrophones and computer-based musical instruments are ephemera lasting long enough to signal academic and technical prowess. They rarely are used more than in a few musical performances. We offer a case study that suggests that longevity of use depends on stabilizing the interface and innovating the implementation to maintain the required stability of performance for players. 

**Context**: Adrian Freed kindly provided a parseable collection of OSC-related papers from his website, ported to the new site by Matt Wright in May 2021
