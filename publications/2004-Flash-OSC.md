# Flash OSC

Ben Chun. *Flash OSC*. 2004.  OSC Conference 2004. 

**Abstract**: In the interest of providing a way to connect various audio synthesizers to Macromedia Flash for both visualization and interface development, flosc is a Java implementation of OSC that works over both TCP and UDP and uses an XML representation of OSC. Examples of the possibilities that this creates will be presented.

**Context**: This was a featured publication on the legacy (pre-2011) opensoundcontrol.org website, ported to the new site by Matt Wright in early 2021
