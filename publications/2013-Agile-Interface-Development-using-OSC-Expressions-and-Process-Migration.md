**Abstract**:  This paper introduces “o.expr,” an expression language for dynamic, object- and agent-oriented computation of gesture signal processing workflows using OSC bundles. The use of o.expr is shown for a range of gesture processing tasks. Aspects of o.expr, including statelessness and homoiconicity, simplify agile applications development and provide support for heterogeneous computational networks. 

**Context**: Adrian Freed kindly provided a parseable collection of OSC-related papers from his website, ported to the new site by Matt Wright in May 2021
