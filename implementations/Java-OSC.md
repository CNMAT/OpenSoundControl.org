## Description

JavaOSC is a library for talking the Open Sound Control (OSC) protocol in Java. It is not, in itself, a usable program. Rather, it is a library designed for building programs that need to communicate over OSC (e.g., SuperCollider, Max/MSP, Reaktor, etc.) <p> JavaOSC is very easy to use: with just a couple of lines you're sending and receiving OSC messages.

## Implementation Details

**Features**: Packet Parsing, Packet Construction

**Supported OSC types**: i: int32, b: blob, s: string, f: float32
