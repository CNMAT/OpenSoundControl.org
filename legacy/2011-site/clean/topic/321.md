I want to write a Max patch that makes the patch a \"host\". For
example, when I use TouchOSC and go to the network page, if there is a
OSC host it is listed.

Granted I can just type the IP address of my computer, but I am looking
to market this patch I am creating and being able to build a patch that
I can name as a host would make connecting much easier.

It has to do with TouchOSC is scanning the network its connected to for
a OSC device. So I guess the question is: how do I register a max patch
as a OSC device??

Thanks\
GW
