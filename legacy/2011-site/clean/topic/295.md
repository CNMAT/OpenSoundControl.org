## workshop:rapid prototyping for gesture-based interaction, via COTS devices

::: {.content}
Dear researchers,

We organize a workshop on the Fun and Game Conference in Leuven. The
topic of the workshop is \"Rapid Prototyping for Gesture-based
Interaction, via Commercial-off-the-Shelf Input Devices\". More
information over the workshop you find on
http://workshopfng2010.blogspot.com/ and http://fng2010.org/. Anyone
interested in participating in this workshop? We are trying to extend
the submission date, because it is already on the 7th of May.

Kind regards,

Maarten Van Overveldt
