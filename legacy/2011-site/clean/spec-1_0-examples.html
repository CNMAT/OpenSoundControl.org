  OSC Address Examples
 </h4>
 <p>
  Suppose a particular OSC Address Space includes an OSC Method with the name
  <br>
  "frequency". This method is contained in an OSC Container with the
  <br>
  name "3", which is contained in another OSC container named "resonators",
  <br>
  which is contained in the OSC container that is the root of the address space
  <br>
  tree. The method's OSC Address is "/resonators/3/frequency".
 </p>
 <p>
  The OSC Address "/a/b/c/d/e" means that:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   The root of the tree contains an OSC Container with the name "a",
  </li>
  <li>
   that OSC Container contains an OSC Container with the name "b",
  </li>
  <li>
   that OSC Container contains an OSC Container with the name "c",
  </li>
  <li>
   that OSC Container contains an OSC Container with the name "d",
   <br>
   and
  </li>
  <li>
   that OSC Container contains an OSC Method with the name "e".
  </li>
 </ul>
 <h4>
  <a name="addressparts">
  </a>
  OSC Address Parts Examples
 </h4>
 <p>
  There are three parts of the OSC Address "/a/b/cde": "a",
  <br>
  "b", and "cde". Note that the last part is the name of the
  <br>
  OSC Method and the other parts are the names of the OSC Containers that (recursively)
  <br>
  contain the method.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are three parts of the OSC Address pattern "/?/b/*c": "?",
  <br>
  "b", and "*c".
 </p>

  OSC Message Examples
 </h4>
 <p>
  In each of these examples, each byte of a message is printed first in hexadecimal,
  <br>
  followed by the corresponding ASCII character in parentheses.
 </p>
 <p>
  The OSC Message with the OSC Address Pattern "/oscillator/4/frequency"
  <br>
  and the floating point number 440.0 as the single argument would be represented
  <br>
  by the following 32-byte message:
 </p>
 <pre>
  2f (/)  6f (o)  73 (s)  63 (c)
  <br>
  69 (i)  6c (l)  6c (l)  61 (a)

  Order of Invocation of OSC Methods matched
  <br>
  by OSC Messages in an OSC Bundle
 </h4>
 <p>
  Suppose an OSC Servers' OSC Address Space includes methods with the following
  <br>
  OSC Addresses:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   /first/this/one
  </li>
  <li>
   /second/1
  </li>
  <li>
   /second/2
  </li>
  <li>
   /third/a
  </li>
  <li>
   /third/b
  </li>
  <li>
   /third/c
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Suppose an OSC Bundle is received that contains three OSC Messages, and that
  <br>
  the three OSC Messages have these OSC Address Patterns:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   /first/this/one
  </li>
  <li>
   /second/[1-2]
  </li>
  <li>
   /third/*
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  Six methods will be invoked in this order:
 </p>
 <p>
  (1) First /first/this/one, since that OSC Address Pattern appeared first in
  <br>
  the OSC Bundle; then
 </p>
 <p>
  (2-3) Either /second/1 followed /second/2 or /second/2 followed by /second/1;
  <br>
  then
 </p>
 <p>
  (3-6) /third/a, /third/b, and /third/c, in any order.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are twelve possible orders in which an OSC server may invoke these six
  <br>
  methods:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   /first/this/one, /second/1, /second/2, /third/a, /third/b, /third/c
  </li>
  <li>
   /first/this/one, /second/1, /second/2, /third/a, /third/c, /third/b
  </li>
  <li>
   /first/this/one, /second/1, /second/2, /third/b, /third/a, /third/c
  </li>
  <li>
   /first/this/one, /second/1, /second/2, /third/b, /third/c, /third/a
  </li>
  <li>
   /first/this/one, /second/1, /second/2, /third/c, /third/a, /third/b
  </li>
  <li>
   /first/this/one, /second/1, /second/2, /third/c, /third/b, /third/a
  </li>
  <li>
   /first/this/one, /second/2, /second/1, /third/a, /third/b, /third/c
  </li>
  <li>
   /first/this/one, /second/2, /second/1, /third/a, /third/c, /third/b
  </li>
  <li>
   /first/this/one, /second/2, /second/1, /third/b, /third/a, /third/c
  </li>
  <li>
   /first/this/one, /second/2, /second/1, /third/b, /third/c, /third/a
  </li>
  <li>
   /first/this/one, /second/2, /second/1, /third/c, /third/a, /third/b
  </li>
  <li>
   /first/this/one, /second/2, /second/1, /third/c, /third/b, /third/a
  </li>
 </ol>
