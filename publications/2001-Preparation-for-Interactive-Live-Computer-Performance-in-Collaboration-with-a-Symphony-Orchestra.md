**Abstract**: This paper describes the design, implementation, and use of an interactive computer-based instrument in the context of a composition for orchestra and live electronics. We will begin with an overview of the piece from a compositional point of view, emphasizing the musical goals for the electronics aspect. Then we will discuss the extremely demanding technical requirements of integrating live electronics with a full orchestra. We will describe the interactive instrument in detail, emphasizing the novel mapping of performer's gestures to computer-generated sound events and the novel OpenSound Control-based structure of the software.

**Context**: This was a featured publication on the legacy (pre-2011) opensoundcontrol.org website, ported to the new site by Matt Wright in early 2021
