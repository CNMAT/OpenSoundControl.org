**Abstract**: Remy Muller (from IRCAM) and I organized an OSC Developers' Meeting at the 2006 NIME conference (http://nime06.ircam.fr). The meeting was organized at the last minute and I profoundly apologize that nobody remembered to send out an invitation to the osc_dev list. Nevertheless, there were about 20 OSC developers in attendance.

**Context**: This was a featured publication on the legacy (pre-2011) opensoundcontrol.org website, ported to the new site by Matt Wright in early 2021
