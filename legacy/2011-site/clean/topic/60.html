  We propose a style of programming in which the entire functionality of each software module is addressable through OSC messages. Advantages of this style include the following:
 </p>
 <p>
  1. The OSC namespace for each module explicitly names all of that module's features. This can enable software to be self-documenting and transparent in its functionality.
 </p>
 <p>
  2. The entire functionality of each module is accessible via a single control mechanism: incoming OSC messages. In graphical languages such as Max/MSP and Pd, this allows even the most complex objects to have a single control inlet, reducing the clutter and confusion of connecting to multiple inlets (Figure 1). As a module's functionality grows, no structural changes (such as adding more inlets) are required; the programmer simply expands the module's OSC namespace.
 </p>
 <p>
  3 . If the components of a complex system already communicate among themselves exclusively with OSC messages, then it becomes very easy to move some of the components to other computers to form a distributed local area network system.
 </p>
 <p>
  4. Certain OSC messages can be standardized across different modules. For example, the message "/gain"Â� with a floating point argument can be used in many different synthesis and processing components to change gain; the message "/namespace"Â� can trigger any module to display its OSC namespace; the message "/go"Â� followed by the argument 1 or 0 can be used to turn on and off the processing in the module; and the message "/init" can initialize a module.
 </p>
 <p>
  By sending the "/namespace"Â� message to the Max/MSP patch above the user is presented with this list of OSC messages and can quickly learn how to control the patch:
  <br>
  1, /go _int_ turn processing on and off;
  <br>
  2, /rate _float_ play rate;
  <br>
  3, /set-position _float_ between 0 and 1 sets position
  <br>
  from start to end;
  <br>
  4, /gain _float_ sets gain;
  <br>
  5, /SDIF-tuples _anything_ talks to SDIF-tuples;
  <br>
  6, /SDIF-buffer _symbol_ sets SDIF-buffer for
  <br>
  7, /sinusoids~ _anything_ talks to sinusoids~;
  <br>
  8, /namespace _bang_ opens this collection;
