## OSC â€" A candidate for lighting applications?

::: {.content}
Hello, I gave a lecture on OSC for the conference \"pro.days 2.0\" of
lighting companies at Media-Academy in Berlin, Germany. Here I tried to
start the discussion for use of OSC in lighting applications and to push
the discussion for a proper name space.\
Here you can download the slides:

Any comments are appreciated (see also email address in slides). Is
there already another approach available?

Regards Frank
