**Abstract**: Since telecommunication can never equal the richness of face-to-face interaction on itsown terms, the most interesting examples of networked music go beyond the paradigm of musicians playing together in a virtual room. The Open Sound Control protocol hasenabled dozens of interesting networked music projects. First the protocol itself isdescribed, followed by a representative list of some of the projects that the protocol has enabled.

**Context**: This was a featured publication on the legacy (pre-2011) opensoundcontrol.org website, ported to the new site by Matt Wright in early 2021
