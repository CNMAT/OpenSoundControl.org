 <tr class="odd"><td valign="top">Full Text</td><td>  <H3>1 Introduction</H3>

<P>A better integration of computers, controllers and sound synthesizers
will lead to lower costs, increased reliability, greater user convenience,
and more reactive musical control. The prevailing technologies to interconnect
these elements are bus (motherboard or PCI), operating system interface
(software synthesis), or serial LAN (Firewire, USB, ethernet, fast ethernet).
It is easy to adapt MIDI streams to this new communication substrate [11].
To do so needlessly discards new potential and perpetuates MIDI's well-documented
flaws. Instead we have designed a new protocol optimized for modern transport
technologies.</P>

<P>Open SoundControl is an open, efficient, transport-independent, message-based
protocol developed for communication among computers, sound synthesizers,
and other multimedia devices. Open SoundControl is a machine and operating
system neutral protocol and readily implementable on constrained, embedded
systems.</P>

<P>We begin by examining various networking technologies suitable for carrying
Open SoundControl data and discuss shared features of these technologies
that impact the design of our protocol.  Next we discuss the encoding and
formatting of data.  We describe our novel addressing scheme based on a
URL-style symbolic syntax.  In our last section we specify a number of query
messages that request information from an Open SoundControl system. </P>

<H3>2 Transport Layer Assumptions</H3>

<P>Open SoundControl is a transport-independent protocol, meaning that it
is a format for data that can be carried across a variety of networking
technologies. Networking technologies currently becoming widely available
and economical include high speed busses such as PCI [8] and medium speed
serial LANs such as USB [10], IEEE-1394 (&quot;Firewire&quot;) [3], Ethernet,
and Fast Ethernet [4].  Although Open SoundControl was not designed with
a particular transport layer in mind, our design reflects features shared
by modern networking technologies.</P>

<P>We assume that Open SoundControl will be transmitted on a system with
a bandwidth in the 10+ megabit/sec range.  MIDI's bandwidth, by contrast,
is only 31.25 kilobit/sec, roughly 300 times slower.  Therefore, our design
is not preoccupied with squeezing musical information into the minimum number
of bytes.  We encode numeric data in 32-bit or 64-bit quantities, provide
symbolic addressing, time-tag messages, and in general are much more liberal
about using bandwidth for important features.</P>

<P>We assume that data will be delivered in packets (a.k.a. &quot;datagrams&quot;)
rather than as a stream of data traveling along an established connection.
 (Although many LANs <I>transmit</I> data serially, they <I>deliver</I>
 the data as a single block.)  This leads to a protocol that is as stateless
as possible: rather than assuming that the receiver holds some state from
previous communications  (e.g., MIDI's running status), we send information
in larger, self-contained chunks that include all the relevant data in one
place.  This packet-based delivery model provides a mechanism for <I>synchronicity</I>:
messages in the same packet (e.g., messages to start each of the notes in
a chord) can be specified to have their effects occur at the same time as
each other.  We assume that the network services will tell us the length
of each packet that we receive.</P>

<P>All modern networking technologies have the notion of multiple devices
connected together in a LAN, with each device able to send a packet to any
other device.  So we assume that any number of clients might send Open SoundControl
messages to a particular device.  We also assume that the transport layer
provides a return address mechanism that allows a device to send a response
back to the device that sends it a message.</P>

<H3>3 Data Representation</H3>

<P>All Open SoundControl data is aligned on 4-byte boundaries.  Numeric
data are encoded using native machine representations of 32-bit or 64-bit
big-endian twos-complement integers and IEEE floating point numbers.  Strings
are represented as a sequence of non-null ASCII characters followed by a
null, padded with enough extra null characters to make the total length
be a multiple of 4 bytes.  These representations facilitate real-time performance
by eliminating the need to reformat received data.  (Except for the unavoidable
big-endian/small-endian conversion.  We note that most small-endian machines
provide special instructions for this conversion.)</P>

<P>The basic unit of Open SoundControl data is a <I>message</I>, which consists
of the following:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>A symbolic address and message name (a string whose meaning is described
  below)
  <LI>Any amount of binary data up to the end of the message, which represent
  the arguments to the message.
</UL>

<P>An Open SoundControl packet can contain either a single message or a
<I>bundle</I>.  A bundle consists of the following:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>The special string &quot;#bundle&quot; (which is illegal as a message
  address)
  <LI>A 64 bit fixed point time tag
  <LI>Any number of messages or bundles, each preceded by a 4-byte integer
  byte count
</UL>

<P>Note that bundles are recursively defined; bundles can contain other
bundles.</P>

<P>Messages in the same bundle are atomic; their effects should be implemented
concurrently by the receiver.  This provides the important service in multimedia
applications of specifying values that have to be set simultaneously.</P>

<P>Time tags allow receiving synthesizers to eliminate jitter introduced
during packet transport by resynchronizing with bounded latency.  They specify
the desired time at which the messages in the bundle should take effect,
a powerful mechanism for precise specification of rhythm and scheduling
of events in the future.  To implement time tags properly, message recipients
need a real-time scheduler like those described by Dannenberg [1].</P>

<P>Time tags are represented by  a 64 bit fixed point number.  The first
32 bits specify the number of seconds since midnight on January 1, 1900,
and the last 32 bits specify fractional parts of a second to a precision
of about 200 picoseconds.  This is the representation used by Internet NTP
timestamps [6].  The Open SoundControl protocol does not provide a mechanism
for clock synchronization; we assume either that the underlying network
will provide a synchronization service or that the two systems will take
advantage of a protocol such as NTP or SNTP [7].</P>

<H3>4 Addressing Scheme</H3>

<P>The model for Open SoundControl message addressing is a hierarchical
set of dynamic objects that include, for example, synthesis voices, output
channels, filters, and a memory manager. Messages are addressed to a feature
of a particular object or set of objects through a hierarchical namespace
similar to URL notation, e.g., /voices/drone-b/resonators/3/set-Q.  This
protocol does not proscribe anything about the objects that should be in
this hierarchy or how they should be organized; each system that can be
controlled by Open SoundControl will define its own address hierarchy. This
open-ended mechanism avoids the addressing limitations inherent in protocols
such as MIDI and ZIPI [5] that rely on short fixed length bit fields.</P>

<P>To allow efficient addressing of multiple destination objects for parameter
updates, we define a pattern-matching syntax similar to regular expressions.
 When a message's address is a pattern, the receiving device expands the
pattern into a list of all the addresses in the current hierarchy that match
the pattern, similar to the way UNIX shell &quot;globbing&quot; interprets
special characters in filenames.  Each address in the list then receives
a message with the given arguments.  </P>

<P>We reserve the following special characters for pattern matching and
forbid their use in object addresses: ?, *, [, ], {, and }. The # character
is also forbidden in object address names to allow the bundle mechanism.
 Here are the rules for pattern matching:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>? matches any single character except /
  <LI>* matches zero or more characters except /
  <LI>A string of characters in square brackets (e.g., [string]) matches
  any character in the string.  Inside square brackets, the minus sign (-)
  and exclamation point (!) have special meanings:  two characters separated
  by a minus sign indicate the range of characters between the given two
  in ASCII collating sequence.  (A minus sign at the end of the string has
  no special meaning.)  An exclamation point at the beginning of a bracketed
  string negates the sense of the list, meaning that the list matches any
  character not in the list.  (An exclamation point anywhere besides the
  first character after the open bracket has no special meaning.)
  <LI>A comma-separated list of strings enclosed in curly braces (e.g., {foo,bar})
  matches any of the strings in the list.
</UL>

<P>Our experience is that with modern transport technologies and careful
programming, this addressing scheme incurs no significant performance penalty
either in network bandwidth utilization or in message processing.</P>

<H3>5 Requests for Information</H3>

<P>Some Open SoundControl messages are requests for information; the receiving
device (which we'll call the <I>Responder</I> in this section) constructs
a response to the request and sends it back to the requesting device (which
we'll call the <I>Questioner</I>).  We assume that the underlying transport
layer will provide a mechanism for sending a reply to the sender of a message.
 </P>

<P>Return messages are formatted according to this same Open SoundControl
protocol.  There is always enough information in a return message to unambiguously
identify what question is being answered; this allows Questioners to send
multiple queries without waiting for a response to each before sending the
next.  The time tag in a return message indicates the time that the Responder
processed the message, i.e., the time at which the information in the response
was true.</P>

<H4>Exploring the Address Space</H4>

<P>Any message address that ends with a trailing slash is a query asking
for the list of addresses underneath the given node.  These messages do
not take arguments.  This kind of query allows the user of an Open SoundControl
system to map out the entire address space of possible messages as the system
is running.</P>

<H4>Message Type Signatures</H4>

<P>Because Open SoundControl messages do not have any explicit type tags
in their arguments, it is necessary for the sender of a message to know
how to lay out the argument values so that they will be interpreted correctly.</P>

<P>An address that ends with the reserved name &quot;/type-signature&quot;
is a query for the &quot;type signature&quot; of a message, i.e., the list
of types of the arguments it expects.  We have a simple syntax for representing
type signatures as strings; see our WWW site for details.</P>

<H4>Requests For Documentation</H4>

<P>An address that ends with the reserved name &quot;/documentation&quot;
is a request for human-readable documentation about the object or feature
specified by the prefix of the address.  The return message will have the
same address as the request, and a single string argument.  The argument
will either be the URL of a WWW page documenting the given object or feature,
or a human-readable string giving the documentation directly.  This allows
for &quot;hot-plugging&quot; extensible synthesis resources and internetworked
multimedia applications.</P>

<H4>Parameter Value Queries</H4>

<P>An address that ends with the reserved name &quot;/current-value&quot;
is a query of the current value of the parameter specified by the prefix
of the address.  Presumably this parameter could be set to its current value
by a message with the appropriate arguments; these arguments are returned
as the arguments to the message from the Responder. The address of the return
message should be the same as the address of the request.</P>

<H3>6 Conclusion</H3>

<P>We have had successful early results transmitting this protocol over
UDP and Ethernet to control real-time sound synthesis on SGI workstations
from MAX [9] programs running on Macintosh computers.  Composers appreciate
being freed from the limited addressing model and limited numeric precision
of MIDI, and find it much easier to work with symbolic names of objects
than to remember an arbitrary mapping involving channel numbers, program
change numbers, and controller numbers.  This protocol affords satisfying
reactive real-time performance.</P>
