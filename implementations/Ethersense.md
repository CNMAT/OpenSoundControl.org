## Description

The EtherSense is a high-resolution, high-speed, robust, cost-effective and versatile tool aimed at making sensor acquisition for gesture analysis easier and designed by IRCAM newly formed Performing Arts Technology Research Team. <p> Able to digitize simultaneously up to 32 16-bit channels at a rate of 500 Hz (1kHz if only 16 used), it brings new opportunities for the integration of motion sensing technology in performance arts and interactive works. <p> With its built-in Ethernet controller, the EtherSense is perfect for computer-based musical control. It transfers digitized sensor signals on Ethernet through Open Sound Control protocol.

## Implementation Details

**Features**: High Speed

**Transport support**: UDP
