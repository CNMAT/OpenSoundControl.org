     Open Sound Control (OSC) has come a long way since we introduced it
     <br>
     in 1997, and we hope and expect to see it keep growing in terms of
     <br>
     number of implementations, completeness of implementations, number of
     <br>
     open source implementations, ease of use, number of users, quantity
     <br>
     and quality of documentation, successful scientific and artistic
     <br>
     projects, and new application areas. The proposed additions to the
     <br>
     standard presented at this conference will add important new features
     <br>
     to the protocol. A better understanding of current technology for
     <br>
     server discovery and session management could lead to recommended
     <br>
     practices that make configuration much easier for users. Better and
     <br>
     more widespread clock synchronization implementations could finally
     <br>
     make OSC's time tags generally useful and widely implemented.
    </p>
    <p>
     One feature that has always made OSC extremely open-ended and
     <br>
     versatile is the lack of specification of what an application's
     <br>
     address space should be. This has allowed people to use OSC for
     <br>
     things we designers never would have imagined, and to make up their
     <br>
     own meaningful names and organization for control structures. At the
     <br>
     same time, this lack of standardization among address spaces means
     <br>
     that there is no guaranteed compatibility among implementations of
     <br>
     OSC; in fact, almost all current uses of OSC involve a
     <br>
     general-purpose programming language for custom handling of a
     <br>
     specific address space. We would like to see a mechanism and culture
     <br>
     supporting developers to share their useful and mature OSC address
     <br>
     spaces with the entire community, which would in turn lead to the
     <br>
     idea of standardized interfaces with a choice of implementations.
    </p>
    <p>
     Five decades of computer music have taught us that it's important to
     <br>
     control sound in many different ways and from many different
     <br>
     perspectives, from low-level sample-by-sample control to
     <br>
     frequency-domain views to "note"-level views to high-level musical
     <br>
     software agents. In many cases the most useful computer music
     <br>
     software simply provides an alternate (often lower-dimensional)
     <br>
     control interface to a more low-level sound control mechanism, e.g.,
     <br>
     real-time neural network control of additive synthesis parameters. We
     <br>
     imagine large collections of software modules with musically rich
     <br>
     behavior, driven by OSC messages. Some of these modules directly
     <br>
     output sound; others output OSC messages targeted at one or more
     <br>
     lower-level modules. The modules might run all on the same machine
     <br>
     or on a collection of networked machines. A module implementing a
     <br>
     standard OSC address space could be replaced by another module
     <br>
     implementing the same address space to add or change functionality
     <br>
     without breaking anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, we have some aspirations for the important role OSC can play
     <br>
     in the development of our favorite application area, which we would
     <br>
     like to call truly enactive musical instrumentation. Most of what
     <br>
     digital media and information technology has brought to music has
     <br>
     left out the human body. Music technology still pretty much looks
     <br>
     like office technology. Live interactive computer music performance
     <br>
     with gestural controllers other than the two traditional keyboards
     <br>
     remains a rarity. So our hope is that further development of OSC
     <br>
     will ease the burden of developing and disseminating a new generation
     <br>
     of computer-based instruments that afford the intimate and expressive
     <br>
     bodily acting-out of music.
    </p>
    <p>
     We look forward to the future of OSC and to the next OSC conference!
