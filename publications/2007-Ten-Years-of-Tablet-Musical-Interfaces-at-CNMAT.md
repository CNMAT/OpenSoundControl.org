**Abstract**: We summarize a decade of musical projects and research employing Wacom digitizing tablets as musical controllers, discussing general implementation schemes using Max/MSP and OpenSoundControl, and specific implementations in musical improvisation, interactive sound installation, interactive multimedia performance, and as a compositional assistant. We examine two-handed sensing strategies and schemes for gestural mapping.

**Context**: This was a featured publication on the legacy (pre-2011) opensoundcontrol.org website, ported to the new site by Matt Wright in early 2021
