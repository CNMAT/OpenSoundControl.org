**Abstract**: ZeroConf/Rendezvous is a protocol for dynamic service discovery over a network, currently being standardized by the IETF. Through ZeroConf, applications and devices may communicate with each other without requiring prior manual configuration or setup. Music applications can take advantage of these capabilities to broadcast and discover the availability of services that communicate over OSC and, thereby, create ad-hoc music networks. Drawing on SuperCollider and Occam as examples, this talk will describe ZeroConf, discuss its benefits and use in the discovery of OSC services, and provide details and hints for programmers wishing to implement similar functionality in their own applications.

**Context**: This was a featured publication on the legacy (pre-2011) opensoundcontrol.org website, ported to the new site by Matt Wright in early 2021
