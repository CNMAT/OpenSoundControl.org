# Bidirectional XML mapping

Ben Chun. *Bidirectional XML mapping*. 2004.  OSC Conference 2004. 

**Abstract**: We present a standard for bidirectional mapping of arbitrary OSC packets to and from XML documents. Such a mapping is already in use as part of the "flosc" implementation of OSC for Macromedia Flash; the purpose of the standard is to ensure that future uses of XML to represent OSC data will be consistent and mutually compatible. The nested structure of OSC bundles containing OSC messages containing type-tagged arguments is represented naturally by nested XML tags, as in this example: [XXX example omitted]

**Context**: This was a featured publication on the legacy (pre-2011) opensoundcontrol.org website, ported to the new site by Matt Wright in early 2021
