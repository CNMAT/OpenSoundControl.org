**Abstract**: In this paper we examine the hardware (sensors and connectivity), physical performance (placement, sensor type, tactile feedback), and musical performance (software development and control) concerns inherent to extending control to six-string chordophones in general, and specifically to the electric guitar (plucked) and electric cello (bowed).

**Context**: This was a featured publication on the legacy (pre-2011) opensoundcontrol.org website, ported to the new site by Matt Wright in early 2021
