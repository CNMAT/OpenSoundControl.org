**Abstract**: We describe the design, implementation, and evaluation with real musical use of a force sensitive multi-touch array of touchpads.  Each of the touchpads supports a three dimensional representation of musical material: two spatial dimensions plus a force measurement we typically use to control dynamics.  Our system uses 24 pads laid out in a ?brick wall? style array that fits nicely under the two hands.  We emphasize the treatment of gestures as sub-sampled audio signals.  This tight coupling of gesture with audio provides for a high degree of control intimacy.

**Context**: Adrian Freed kindly provided a parseable collection of OSC-related papers from his website, ported to the new site by Matt Wright in May 2021
