  Hello,
 </p>
 <p>
  ArKaos GrandVJ, the famous realtime interactive video software for VJ and other video artists supports now OSC in its new 1.1 release.
 </p>
 <p>
  Please take a look at the new features and the downloadable demo at http://forum.arkaos.net/viewtopic.php?t=5772
 </p>
 <p>
  One question for the osc.org administrators: would it be possible to add ArKAos GrandVJ in the Implementations list ?
 </p>
 <p>
  Thank you very much!
 </p>
