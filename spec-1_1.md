# OpenSoundControl 1.1 

The most accurate document reflecting the 1.1 vision is the [NIME 2009
paper](files/2009-NIME-OSC-1.1.pdf)
([zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/1177517)).

Note that the OSC 1.1 Paper refers to a specification for 1.1 that was
never published; there is no 1.1 "specification" in the style of the
[1.0 "specification"](spec-1_0.html).  Andy Schmeder and Adrian Freed
"decided to let the above NIME paper stand as the authoratitive
reflection of what we had in mind."
