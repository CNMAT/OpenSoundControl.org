     The
     <strong>
      DiABlu System
     </strong>
     is an application that
     <strong>
      detects
     </strong>
     the presence of
     <strong>
      Bluetooth
     </strong>
     enabled devices and communicates their names and ids to other applications.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's intended to be used in
     <strong>
      art instalations
     </strong>
     by digital artists who wish to give their audience a novel way to
     <strong>
      interact
     </strong>
     with their pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
     Besides informing the application of the names of the currently present devices, the DiABlu system has also a mobile application that can be installed in a Java enabled phone that will allow the user to transmit data to the final application.
    </p>
    <p>
     The system communicates via the
     <strong>
      OSC
     </strong>
     protocol so that applications written in Max/MSP, Pure Data, Processing, Flash, or any other with OSC support , will be able to use this system.
    </p>
    <p>
     DiABlu is a project conceived by
