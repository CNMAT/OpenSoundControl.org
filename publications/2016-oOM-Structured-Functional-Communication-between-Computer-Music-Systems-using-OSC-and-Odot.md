**Abstract**:  O.—odot—is a portable media programming framework based on the OSC data encoding. It embeds a small expression language which allows writing and executing programs in OSC structures. The integration of programming and declarative functional descriptions within data transfer protocols enables structured and expressive communication in media systems: program snippets can be distributed in OSC messages, which evaluate to further OSC messages in the different communicating software. We present experiments using this framework in the OpenMusic computer-aided composition environment , and illustrate via case studies some advantages of such integrated system.
