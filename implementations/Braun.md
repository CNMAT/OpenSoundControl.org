## Description

Braun is an application for visualising Open Sound Control (OSC) data. It acts as an OSC server, listening for data on port 4444. If it receives numerical OSC data on this port, it will plot the data on a scrolling graph. The graph can be zoomed using the toolbar or the 'view' menu, and re-sized by resizing the Braun window. The graph can be saved as a PNG image using 'Save As...' under the file menu. <p> Braun was written in Python, and uses wxPython, FloatCanvas and PyLiblo.

## Implementation Details

**Platform(s)**: Any / Platform Independent

**Supported OSC types**: i: int32, f: float32, h: int64, d: float64
