It features 12 1/4" TRS jacks for attaching expression and switch pedal inputs or outputting control voltages, Qwiic connections for IIC (I2C) devices and a 20x4 backlit LCD character display which is used for configuration and as a cue display. The device is designed to be PoE powered, but can also be powered via 5V micro-USB supply or external LiPo battery.  Once booted, the device waits for an incoming OSC message and sets the source IP address of that message as its target.  The state of all of its ports are then transmitted to this address as OSC bundles.  The hardware and code are designed to allow configuration of inputs & outputs on the fly.  Once connected, the '/configuration/*/' message can be used to change the state of any port.

CNMAT has developed a solution using the ubiquitous 100BaseT Ethernet that supports up to 10 channels of 24-bit audio, 64 channels of sample-synchronous control-rate gesture data, and 4 precisely time-stamped MIDI I/O streams. Latency measurements show that we can get signals into and back out of Max/MSP in under 7 milliseconds. The central component in the device is a field programmable gate array (FPGA). In addition to providing a variety of computer interface capabilities, the device can function as a cross-coder for a variety of protocols including GMICS.

It does not, however, take into account timestamp values or provide a cpu-scalable message dispatching, and it may not be suitable for use inside a realtime thread as it allocates memory when building or reading messages. <p> Note: You may have to make some changes to the UDP file to be able to use it with MinGW on Windows.

TJShow allows show designers to link OSC paths to cues (so timelines can be triggered from OSC) or variables (variable can be changed through OSC). Currently, it only supports UDP/IP as transport for OSC.

First, RF transmissions are regulated by local FCC and it\'s pretty difficult to find radio channels available and authorized worldwide. Second, sharing a single radio carrier requires a good and robust protocol to avoid collision of information. [IEEE 802.11](http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/802/11) standard was designed for this purpose with a CSMA/CA (collision avoidance) mechanism and statistic delays before transmitting to autoregulate traffic and probability of being able to transmit when you need to. <p> The challenge was to make a WiFi pocket size digitizer, not base on a tiny linux board, but designed from scratch in order to be as close as possible from the hardware (an of-the-shelf CompactFlash 802.11b card) and an optimised UDP/IP stack. 802.11 is actually \"only\" a transportation layer for 802.3 (Ethernet) : OSC was then just as close as it can be. <p> The basic implementation of OSC is like the one of the Ethersense Project.\ **/WBxx \[16 int list\]**		Packet Construction	i: int32			UDP			Defunct	11-Mar-21			Last archive.org mirror dates to 2011: https://web.archive.org/web/20090607070454/http://recherche.ircam.fr/equipes/temps-reel/movement/flety/static.php?page=static050309-144808

A server, when listening, can receive these packets and action upon them. Depending on a client or server using either UDP or TCP as a transport, there are varying levels of functionality and delegate methods for you to take advantage of.
