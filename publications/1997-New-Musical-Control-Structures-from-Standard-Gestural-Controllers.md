**Abstract**:  We have adapted a digitizing tablet as a musical gestural controller. We characteristize the device in terms of the data it outputs, the resolution of that data, and temporal behavior. We define a powerful, high-level model for mapping tablet data to musical control information and conclude with a list of example applications. 

**Context**: Adrian Freed kindly provided a parseable collection of OSC-related papers from his website, ported to the new site by Matt Wright in May 2021
