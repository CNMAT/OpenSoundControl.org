  I am currently coordinating the OSC hardware working group. My first tasks are recruit collaborators and to organize a clear definition of the scope of work of the group. Here are some possible goals:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Develop an affordable (<$200) hardware kit analagous to the OSC Software Kit as a platform or inspiration for future embedded OSC. Some interesting new platforms need to be evaluated, e.g., http://www.picotux.com/
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Develop a standardized message vocabulary for embedded OSC, especially for sensor interface boxes: It would be useful to promote standard naming conventions for the parameters and units for the measurands. It would be interesting to include (subsume?) some of  the Device Class Definition of HID: http://www.usb.org/developers/hidpage/. A good starting point for this activity might by documenting the OSC messgae format used by the p5OSC program: http://noisybox.net/computers/p5glove/.
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   Develop the hardware support for the clock distribution required for scheduling OSC messages accurately.
   <p>
   </p>
   <lib>
    Support the development and distribution of devices that employ OSC, e.g.
