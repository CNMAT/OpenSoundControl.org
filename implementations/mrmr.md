## Description

Mrmr is an ongoing open-source research project to develop a standardized set of protocols and syntax conventions to control live installations and multimedia performances via mobile devices. The project is currently spearheaded by Eric Redlinger, researcher-in-residence at Brooklyn Polytechnic University√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√¢‚Äû¬¢s Integrated Digital Media Institute. <p> Simply put, Mrmr is a technology that enables you to use ordinary cell phones and PDAs as controllers in audio-visual performances, or to participate in interactive museum exhibits, or to use your mobile device in the place of the mouse or trackpad from your full-size computer. <p> Key elements of the Mrmr project are: <p> * create your own interface using only a text editor * multiuser by design / client peer-to-peer or client-server models supported * open standards (zeroconfig/bonjour/mdns, OSC), open source * dynamic interfaces: widgets can be reconfigured 'on the fly'
