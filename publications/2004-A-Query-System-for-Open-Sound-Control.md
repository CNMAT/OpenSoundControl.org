**Abstract**: A query system is proposed for inter-application control scenarios. The features consist of namespace exploration, documentation, type-signature, return-type-signature and parameter constraint specification, current-value polling, identification of common interpretation maps via osc-schema, as well as a general error reporting and reply mechanism.  (Presentation [slides](../files/aws-query-cmd-system-osc04.pdf))

**Context**: This was a featured publication on the legacy (pre-2011) opensoundcontrol.org website, ported to the new site by Matt Wright in early 2021
