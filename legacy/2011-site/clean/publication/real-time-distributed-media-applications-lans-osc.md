               [ Abstract                         An increasing number of interactive
     ]{.biblio-row-title}                         applications must deal with real-time
                                                  processing, and/or management of large
                                                  databases of media (i.e., text, sound,
                                                  images, videos). Often, limitations with
                                                  computing power, requirements for
                                                  distributing knowledge, availability and
                                                  convenience of programming environments,
                                                  make most intensive systems often
                                                  fragmented across machines and even
                                                  locations. These programs must exchange
                                                  streaming data quickly, and seamlessly.\

                                                  prototypes such systems. However,
                                                  emphasis is often given on interactivity
                                                  and content management rather than on
                                                  communication technology. Open Sound
                                                  Control (OSC) enables fast prototyping
                                                  development of efficient communicating
                                                  programs regardless of the programming
                                                  language, computer architecture, and

                                                  applications include: real-time sound
                                                  analysis of a symphony orchestra and
                                                  synthesis of electronic sound masses;
                                                  analysis and sound morphing of a singing
                                                  voice with the â€œHyperviolinâ€�;
                                                  SMS-ruled image database retrieval;
                                                  high-dimensional and motion-controlled
                                                  sound synthesis interfaces; a media
                                                  jukebox; and an interactive online radio
                                                  art installation. These applications use
                                                  a wide range of environments and
                                                  languages such as C++, Java,
                                                  Max/MSP/Jitter, Supercollider, CSL,
