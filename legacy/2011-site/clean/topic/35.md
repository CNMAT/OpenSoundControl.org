## IEEE 1588 precise time protocol

::: {.content}
Now that [this standard](http://ieee1588.nist.gov/PTTI_draft_final.pdf)
is so mature it is time to consider how to use it in OSC. It is already
integrated into high quality time reference hardware and in [Intel
network
processors](http://download.intel.com/design/network/papers/30506801.pdf)
.

This paper on packet timestamping seems particularly useful:\
