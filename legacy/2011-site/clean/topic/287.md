## iPhone to Max: certain int messages get zero\'d

::: {.content}
I\'m using OSC_writeAddress() followed by OSC_writeIntArg() to send OSC
buffers from iPhone to max, 1 packet at a time. my range of values goes
from 0 - 320. this works for integers 0 - 53, 74 - 127, 197 - 309
inclusive but all other values that i try to send arrive at max as
0.000000.

i can\'t seem to get float args decoded properly at all on the max side
and using writeAddressAndTypes doesn\'t work either.

Does anybody know where these 0\'s are coming from??

Thanks.
