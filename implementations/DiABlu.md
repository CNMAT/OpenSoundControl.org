## Description

![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200929194218im_/http://jorgecardoso.org/DiABlu/diablulogojoomla.gif) The **DiABlu System** is an application that **detects** the presence of **Bluetooth** enabled devices and communicates their names and ids to other applications. <p> It's intended to be used in **art instalations** by digital artists who wish to give their audience a novel way to **interact** with their pieces. <p> Besides informing the application of the names of the currently present devices, the DiABlu system has also a mobile application that can be installed in a Java enabled phone that will allow the user to transmit data to the final application. <p> The system communicates via the **OSC** protocol so that applications written in Max/MSP, Pure Data, Processing, Flash, or any other with OSC support , will be able to use this system. <p> DiABlu is a project conceived by [Jorge Cardoso](http://jorgecardoso.org/) at the [School of Arts](http://artes.ucp.pt/) of the [Portuguese Catholic University](http://www.porto.ucp.pt/) and it's being developed by Nuno Rodrigues at the [Research Center for Science and Technology in Art (CITAR)](http://soundserver.porto.ucp.pt/citar/index1.html) . <p> This is an Open Source Project. It's licensed under [GPL 2.0](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html) . <p> The [project source](http://code.google.com/p/diablu/) is hosted on Google Code. <p> There is also a [discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/diablu) where you can post any questions you might have.
