**Abstract**: The basic control structure of VST audio plug-ins can limit their usefulness. Control can be improved through the use of Open Sound Control by developing a flexible name space that employs multiple, intuitive parameter names (and aliases), higher-level controls and range mapping, simplifying control for the user. We will demonstrate these ideas with Max/MSP patches that repackage VST plug-ins in a more usable way and also introduce the idea that plug-in interfaces themselves can be improved by building in a well-formed OSC name space. Such a name space would enhance the longevity and flexibility of finished musical works. We will also show that when the plug-in is controlled directly with OSC atomicity and queries, control could be further improved.

**Context**: This was a featured publication on the legacy (pre-2011) opensoundcontrol.org website, ported to the new site by Matt Wright in early 2021
