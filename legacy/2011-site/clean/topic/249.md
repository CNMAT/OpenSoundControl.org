Hey, this question is maybe a little bit outside of the OSC idea but my
creative partner and I are trying to find out if there is a way for us
to sync our laptops, as in allow us to trigger the files from one
computer or the other and be guaranteed that the sound files will start
in agreement with whatever is already happening. I\'m not sure that
makes sense exactly but if anyone has any ideas, much appreciated.
