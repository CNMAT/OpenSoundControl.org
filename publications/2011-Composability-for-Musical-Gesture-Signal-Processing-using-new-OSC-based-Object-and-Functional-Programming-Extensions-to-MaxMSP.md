**Abstract**:  An effective programming style for gesture signal processing is described using a new library that brings efficient run-time polymorphism, functional and instance-based object-oriented programming to Max/MSP. By introducing better support for generic programming and composability Max/MSP becomes a more productive environment for managing the growing scale and complexity of gesture sensing systems for musical instruments and interactive installations. 

**Context**: Adrian Freed kindly provided a parseable collection of OSC-related papers from his website, ported to the new site by Matt Wright in May 2021
