Most internet uses of OSC use UDP which is trivial to spoof. This and
the potential expense of a message constructed with a broad matching
pattern mean that OSC applications are susceptible to Denial of Service
attacks.

The easiest workaround is to use TCP which is harder to spoof. Can
anyone help develop the appropriate magic to make the UDP implementation
more robust?
