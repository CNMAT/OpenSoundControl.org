**Abstract**:  The paper introduces new fiber and malleable materials including piezoresistive fabric, conductive heat-shrink tubing and shows techniques and examples of how they may be used for rapid prototyping and agile develop of musical instrument controllers. New implementations of well-known designs are covered as well as enhancement of existing controllers. Finally two new controllers are introduced that are made possible by these recently available new materials and construction techniques 

**Context**: Adrian Freed kindly provided a parseable collection of OSC-related papers from his website, ported to the new site by Matt Wright in May 2021
