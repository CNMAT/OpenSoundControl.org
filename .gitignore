# These may become problems but don't check them into the repo for now:
# *.pdf

# In general html files should be generated from the corresponding md
#  files and therefore not checked into the repo...
*.html

# ...except that some of our saved legacy site content came as html
#  files, so allow those in the repo.
!legacy/**/*.html

# Also Adrian's "annotated" paper is done in pure html
!OSCGestureMapping/index.html
