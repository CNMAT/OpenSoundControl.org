[Joe
Armstrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Armstrong_(programmer)),
2016 "[A Badass Way to Connect Programs
Together](https://joearms.github.io/#2016-01-28%20A%20Badass%20Way%20to%20Connect%20Programs%20Together)":
"I could collaborate with him by sending him OSC messages over UDP and
didn't have to understand one iota of how his application was built
and structured. It didn't matter all I had to do was understand the
messaging protocol." "Simplicity by Design"

[Ilias Bergstr√∂m](https://kth.academia.edu/IliasBergstrom) (aka [The
Wizard of OSC](https://thewizardofosc.com)), 2020, "[What is
OSC?](https://thewizardofosc.com/more-on-osc/)": "OSC gives musicians
and developers more flexibility in the kinds of data they can send
over the wire, enabling new applications that can communicate with
each other at a high level."

[Dave Phillips](https://www.linuxjournal.com/users/dave-phillips),
2008, "[An Introduction To
OSC](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/introduction-osc)": "OSC's
design addresses and resolves MIDI's most frustrating aspects,
particularly regarding transport speed and the assumptions of use. No
restriction is placed on pitch representation or any other musical
representation, as long as the data format is supported by the
protocol." Detailed example: AlgoScore drives AVSynthesis.
