               [ Abstract                         SonART is a flexible, multi-purpose
     ]{.biblio-row-title}                         multimedia environment that allows for
                                                  networked collaborative interaction with
                                                  applications for art, science and
                                                  industry. It provides an open-ended
                                                  framework for integration of powerful
                                                  image and audio processing methods with
                                                  flexible network features. An arbitrary
                                                  number of layered canvases, each with
                                                  independent control of opacity, RGB
                                                  values, image position, compositing
                                                  options, etc., can transmit or receive
                                                  data using OpenSoundControl. Data from
                                                  images can be used for synthesis or audio
                                                  signal processing and vice versa.
                                                  Applications of SonART include multimedia
                                                  art, collaborative and interactive art
                                                  and design, and scientific and diagnostic
                                                  exploration of data.\

                                                  Originally created for sound-driven data
                                                  exploration and diagnostic purposes, the
                                                  software also provides a powerful tool
                                                  for multimedia performance over a network
                                                  and facilitates real-time interactive
                                                  creation, manipulation and exploration of
                                                  audio and images. Now it is implemented
                                                  as a Cocoa-based OS X application.
                                                  Functionality includes the ability to
                                                  load and draw multi-layered images, and
                                                  to send/receive visual and control data
                                                  to/from other multimedia programs that
                                                  support OSC.\
