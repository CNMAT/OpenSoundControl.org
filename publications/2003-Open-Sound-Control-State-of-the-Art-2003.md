**Abstract**: OpenSoundControl ("OSC") is a protocol for communication among computers, sound synthesizers, and other multimedia devices that is optimized for modern networking technology. OSC has achieved wide use in the field of computer-based new interfaces for musical expression for wide-area and local-area networked distributed music systems, inter-process communication, and even within a single application.

**Context**: This was a featured publication on the legacy (pre-2011) opensoundcontrol.org website, ported to the new site by Matt Wright in early 2021
