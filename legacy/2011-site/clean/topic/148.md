Hello!

I had some thoughts about killing MIDI and transferring all the
functions to OSC while upgrading and expanding them.

I introduced a standardized namespace within OSC, \'/SYN/\', which shall
hold all necessary methods for communication between controllers, hosts
and synths.

Please HELP CONTRIBUTE. It\'s really easy in the Wiki now:

I will add everyone to the wiki who is interested in contributing.
