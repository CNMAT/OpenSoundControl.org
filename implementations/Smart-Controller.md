## Description

The Smart Controller is a portable hardware device that allows performers to create music using Programmable Logic Control. The device can be programmed remotely through the use of the Smart Controller Workbench, which is an independent computer application that functions as a Patch Editor, Simulator, and debugger that can communicate with the hardware. The Smart Controller responds to input control voltage, MIDI, and Open Sound Control messages, producing output control voltage, MIDI, and Open Sound Control messages (depending upon the patch). The Smart Controller is a stand alone device -- a powerful, reliable, and compact instrument -- capable of reducing the number of electronic modules required, particularly the requirement of a laptop computer, in a live performance.
