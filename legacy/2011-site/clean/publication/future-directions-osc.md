Open Sound Control (OSC) has come a long way since we introduced it\
in 1997, and we hope and expect to see it keep growing in terms of\
number of implementations, completeness of implementations, number of\
open source implementations, ease of use, number of users, quantity\
and quality of documentation, successful scientific and artistic\
projects, and new application areas. The proposed additions to the\
standard presented at this conference will add important new features\
to the protocol. A better understanding of current technology for\
server discovery and session management could lead to recommended\
practices that make configuration much easier for users. Better and\
more widespread clock synchronization implementations could finally\
make OSC\'s time tags generally useful and widely implemented.

One feature that has always made OSC extremely open-ended and\
versatile is the lack of specification of what an application\'s\
address space should be. This has allowed people to use OSC for\
things we designers never would have imagined, and to make up their\
own meaningful names and organization for control structures. At the\
same time, this lack of standardization among address spaces means\
that there is no guaranteed compatibility among implementations of\
OSC; in fact, almost all current uses of OSC involve a\
general-purpose programming language for custom handling of a\
specific address space. We would like to see a mechanism and culture\
supporting developers to share their useful and mature OSC address\
spaces with the entire community, which would in turn lead to the\
idea of standardized interfaces with a choice of implementations.

Five decades of computer music have taught us that it\'s important to\
control sound in many different ways and from many different\
perspectives, from low-level sample-by-sample control to\
frequency-domain views to \"note\"-level views to high-level musical\
software agents. In many cases the most useful computer music\
software simply provides an alternate (often lower-dimensional)\
control interface to a more low-level sound control mechanism, e.g.,\
real-time neural network control of additive synthesis parameters. We\
imagine large collections of software modules with musically rich\
behavior, driven by OSC messages. Some of these modules directly\
output sound; others output OSC messages targeted at one or more\
lower-level modules. The modules might run all on the same machine\
or on a collection of networked machines. A module implementing a\
standard OSC address space could be replaced by another module\
implementing the same address space to add or change functionality\
without breaking anything else.

Finally, we have some aspirations for the important role OSC can play\
in the development of our favorite application area, which we would\
like to call truly enactive musical instrumentation. Most of what\
digital media and information technology has brought to music has\
left out the human body. Music technology still pretty much looks\
like office technology. Live interactive computer music performance\
with gestural controllers other than the two traditional keyboards\
remains a rarity. So our hope is that further development of OSC\
will ease the burden of developing and disseminating a new generation\
of computer-based instruments that afford the intimate and expressive\
bodily acting-out of music.

We look forward to the future of OSC and to the next OSC conference!
