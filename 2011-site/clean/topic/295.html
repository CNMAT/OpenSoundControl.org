  Dear researchers,
 </p>
 <p>
  We organize a workshop on the Fun and Game Conference in Leuven. The topic of the workshop is "Rapid Prototyping for Gesture-based Interaction, via Commercial-off-the-Shelf Input Devices". More information over the workshop you find on http://workshopfng2010.blogspot.com/ and http://fng2010.org/. Anyone interested in participating in this workshop? We are trying to extend the submission date, because it is already on the 7th of May.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kind regards,
 </p>
 <p>
  Maarten Van Overveldt
