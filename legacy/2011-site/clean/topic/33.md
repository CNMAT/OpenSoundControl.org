## New Oppurtunity for Flash and OSC integration

::: {.content}
The next rev. of Flash supports [binary
sockets](http://livedocs.macromedia.com/labs/1/flex/langref/flash/net/Socket.html)
. Could a flash developer please implement OSC in ActionScript 3.0 using
the socket interface for UDP and TCP transport.

Since ActionScript is a variant of EcmaScript such an implementation
would be useful in other contexts, e.g., firefox, Max/MSP JS etc.
