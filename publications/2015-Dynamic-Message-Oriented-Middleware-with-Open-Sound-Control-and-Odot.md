**Abstract**:  We present recent work on odot, a system that extends Open Sound Control and facilitates the rapid and dynamic construction of Message-Oriented Middleware providing an interoperability layer for communication between applications. Unlike traditional middleware systems, odot, when embedded in a host environment, provides a node where computation can take place, allowing middleware to take shape dynamically as the needs of the system develop. 

**Context**: Adrian Freed kindly provided a parseable collection of OSC-related papers from his website, ported to the new site by Matt Wright in May 2021
