  Does the CNMAT OpenSoundControl external support 64-bit double precision floats?
 </p>
 <p>
  according to this link, it does, but I have had no luck getting any output sending it an
  <br>
  osc message with a "d" in it.

 </p>
 <p>
  Is the source code for this external available anywhere? I would ideally like to dig into it and see what format it
  <br>
  expects a double in, (endianess etc), if at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  I've done a fair bit of googling, and digging around on the CNMAT website,
  <br>
  but can't find any more information about it.

  Thanks,
