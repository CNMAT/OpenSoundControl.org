<h2>
 Networked LAN Musical Performance
</h2>
<div class="content">
 <p>
  A group of musicians operate a group of computers that are connected on a LAN. Each computer is somewhat independent (e.g., it produces sound in response to local input) yet the computers control each other in some ways (e.g., by sharing a global tempo clock or by  controlling some of each others' parameters.) This is somewhat analogous to multi-player gaming.

  <em>
   Each player can control some of the parameters of every other player

 <ul>
  <li>
   At ICMC 2000 in Berlin (

   </a>
   ), a network of about 12 Macintoshes running SuperCollider synthesized sound and changed each others’ parameters via OSC, inspired by David Tudor’s composition "Rainforest."

  <li>
   The Meta-Orchestra project (Impett and Bongers, 2001) is a large local-area network that uses OSC.
