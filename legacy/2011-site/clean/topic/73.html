  We are currently considering changing syntax for control messages in

  to be OSC-compatible. (Jamoma is a proposition of a clear structure and common features for building max patches, reducing the amount of time needed to create new performance systems, and enhancing the interchange of patches amongst max users). One of the issues we could need some help clarifying is how to best translate current syntax into OSC-compatible syntax.
 </p>
 <p>
  With the current syntax, you would send the following message to an audio module in order to instantly change midi gain:
 </p>
 <p>
  gain_midi 127
 </p>
 <p>
  For relevant parameters it is possible to ramp to a new value over a specifiec amount of time. E.g. to ramp to midi gain 127 in 3 secs. you would send the following message:
 </p>
 <p>
  gain_midi 127 3000
 </p>
 <p>
  If we decide to change the syntax to be OSC-compatible it is pretty straight forward what syntax should be when instantly changing midi gain:
 </p>
 <p>
  /gain_midi 127
 </p>
 <p>
  What syntax would be recommended in the case that gain instead is to ramp to a new value over 3 secs?
 </p>
 <p>
  The following would be the most straight forward translation:
 </p>
 <p>
  /gain_midi 127 3000
 </p>
 <p>
  Then again I'm wondering if a separate namespace would be required/preferred for ramp time. This might be easy to read, but could possible require more and less intuitive typing in cue scripts (e.g. should ramp always be reset to 0?):
 </p>
 <p>
  /gain_midi/ramp 3000
  <br>
  /gain_midi/value 127
 </p>
 <p>
  In his presentation at the 2004 OSC conference, James McCartney seems to indicate the use of a single level name space, and hashed commands in SuperCollider:
 </p>
 <p>
  /gain_midi 127 ramp 3000
 </p>
 <p>
  Are there any official guidelines to inform us on what of these possible syntaxes would be recomended?
 </p>
 <p>
  Thanks,
