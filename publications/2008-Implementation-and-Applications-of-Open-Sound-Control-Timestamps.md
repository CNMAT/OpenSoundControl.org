**Abstract**:  The background, purpose, and function of Open Sound  Control (OSC) timestamps is reviewed. An analysis  shows that jitter-induced noise with dispersion over the  millisecond range significantly degrades real-time highresolution  sensor signal streams. The design of a  distributed clock synchronization and event scheduling  domain over an asynchronous network is described. A  realization of this model is presented, created using the  new micro-OSC (uOSC) hardware platform and host  software components in MaxMSP. An OSC address  schema for client-server clock synchronization is  documented. Two new objects for MaxMSP are  introduced: OSC-timetag and OSC-schedule. 

**Context**: Adrian Freed kindly provided a parseable collection of OSC-related papers from his website, ported to the new site by Matt Wright in May 2021
