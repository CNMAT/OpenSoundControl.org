<h2>
 UDP Spoofing and DOS attacks

  Most internet uses of OSC use UDP which is trivial to spoof. This and the potential expense of a message constructed with a broad matching pattern mean that OSC applications are susceptible to Denial of Service attacks.

  The easiest workaround is to use TCP which is harder to spoof. Can anyone help develop the appropriate magic to make the UDP implementation more robust?
