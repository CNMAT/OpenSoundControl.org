## Addressing software using OSC messages

::: {.content}
We propose a style of programming in which the entire functionality of
each software module is addressable through OSC messages. Advantages of
this style include the following:

1\. The OSC namespace for each module explicitly names all of that
module\'s features. This can enable software to be self-documenting and
transparent in its functionality.

2\. The entire functionality of each module is accessible via a single
control mechanism: incoming OSC messages. In graphical languages such as
Max/MSP and Pd, this allows even the most complex objects to have a
single control inlet, reducing the clutter and confusion of connecting
to multiple inlets (Figure 1). As a module\'s functionality grows, no
structural changes (such as adding more inlets) are required; the
programmer simply expands the module\'s OSC namespace.

3 . If the components of a complex system already communicate among
themselves exclusively with OSC messages, then it becomes very easy to
move some of the components to other computers to form a distributed
local area network system.

4\. Certain OSC messages can be standardized across different modules.
For example, the message \"/gain\"Â� with a floating point argument can
be used in many different synthesis and processing components to change
gain; the message \"/namespace\"Â� can trigger any module to display its
OSC namespace; the message \"/go\"Â� followed by the argument 1 or 0 can
be used to turn on and off the processing in the module; and the message
\"/init\" can initialize a module.

By sending the \"/namespace\"Â� message to the Max/MSP patch above the
user is presented with this list of OSC messages and can quickly learn
how to control the patch:\
1, /go \_int\_ turn processing on and off;\
2, /rate \_float\_ play rate;\
3, /set-position \_float\_ between 0 and 1 sets position\
from start to end;\
4, /gain \_float\_ sets gain;\
5, /SDIF-tuples \_anything\_ talks to SDIF-tuples;\
6, /SDIF-buffer \_symbol\_ sets SDIF-buffer for\
7, /sinusoids\~ \_anything\_ talks to sinusoids\~;\
8, /namespace \_bang\_ opens this collection;
