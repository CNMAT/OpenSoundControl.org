The [Skype
API](http://share.skype.com/developer_zone/documentation/api_v1.3_documentation/)
documents a simple text based messaging protocol between clients and
Skype. I believe we could develop a discovery and session management
scheme for OSC based on Skype. A simple hack would be to use the chat
message functions to send the agreed upon udp or tcp port and ip
addresses for an \"OSC\" session.\
Skype provides all the user name space management and authentication
stuff for free and is becoming very widely adopted.

Another interesting tack would be to build an OSC PAL (Protocol
Adaptation Layer) for the Skype API. This would allow users to create
OSC servers for Skype functions.
