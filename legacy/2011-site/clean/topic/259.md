Hello,

ArKaos GrandVJ, the famous realtime interactive video software for VJ
and other video artists supports now OSC in its new 1.1 release.

Please take a look at the new features and the downloadable demo at
http://forum.arkaos.net/viewtopic.php?t=5772

One question for the osc.org administrators: would it be possible to add
ArKAos GrandVJ in the Implementations list ?

Thank you very much!

Xavier Miller,\
Software Application Developer at ArKaos.
