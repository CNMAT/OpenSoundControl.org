# La Kitchen's "Toaster" and "Kroonde" wired and wireless Data-Acquisition Systems

Leslie Stuck. *La Kitchen's "Toaster" and "Kroonde" wired and wireless Data-Acquisition Systems*. 2004.  OSC Conference 2004. 

**Abstract**: The Kroonde is a system for receiving data from any industry-standard 0-5 volt sensor (e.g., pressure, flexion, acceleration, magnetic field strength, light intensity), sending the data via a small wireless transmitter to a central processor, and converting the data to either MIDI or OSC using UDP over 10 BaseT Ethernet. A demonstration will present strategies for using the data in a Max/MSP environment.

**Context**: This was a featured publication on the legacy (pre-2011) opensoundcontrol.org website, ported to the new site by Matt Wright in early 2021
