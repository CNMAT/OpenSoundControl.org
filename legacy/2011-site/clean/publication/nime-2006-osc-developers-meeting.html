     Remy Muller (from IRCAM) and I organized an OSC Developers' Meeting at the 2006 NIME conference (http://nime06.ircam.fr).  The meeting was organized at the last minute and I profoundly apologize that nobody remembered to send out an invitation to the osc_dev list.  Nevertheless, there were about 20 OSC developers in attendance.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here are my notes and recollections from the meeting, organized by the topic.  I was too busy running the meeting to take proper notes, so I apologize to the now-anonymous participants whose ideas I remember but whose names I did not write down.   In typing these notes I also added an "action items" section that is a mixture of things that were mentioned in the meeting and my own personal vision about concrete steps to move forward on each topic.
    </p>
    <p>
     I'm sorry to begin these notes with three apologies. ;-)
    </p>
    <h2>
     Finalize agenda
    </h2>
    <p>
     Everybody seemed happy with my proposed agenda, so we went with it as-is.
    </p>
    <h2>
     http://www.opensoundcontrol.org
    </h2>
    <p>
     I showed off the new OSC web site (via video projection of my laptop).  I exhorted OSC developers to get accounts on the new web site, explaining that it's the usual simple situation where you fill out a form and then the system emails you your password.  Here are some of the pages I pointed out:
    </p>
    <p>
     http://opensoundcontrol.org/bs (Thanks to Dan Overholt for suggesting this topic and URL)
     <br>
     http://www.opensoundcontrol.org/bs/maxmsp
     <br>
     http://www.opensoundcontrol.org/implementations
     <br>
     http://www.opensoundcontrol.org/queries
     <br>
     http://www.opensoundcontrol.org/schemas
     <br>
     http://www.opensoundcontrol.org/discovery
    </p>
    <p>
     The current http://opensoundcontrol.org home page was universally acknowledged to be a horrible front page.  Some of the JazzMutant people offered to join an "OSC Lobbying" working group with the task of making the home page "sexier".  It should accomplish the following:
    </p>
    <p>
     - Look "professional"
     <br>
     - Answer the question "why OSC?"
     <br>
     - Convince nontechnical end-users of the advantages of OSC (modularity, versatility, bidirectional, high performance...)
     <br>
     - Convince developers of the advantages of OSC
     <br>
     - Convince marketing people, CEOs, managers, etc., of the advantages of OSC
     <br>
     - Reflect the vibrant ongoing activity of the OSC community
     <br>
     - Lead into other parts of the site.
    </p>
    <p>
     Action items: redo the front page, update and improve the site in general.
    </p>
    <h2>
     Standardized Address spaces and schemas
    </h2>
    <p>
     I proposed http://www.opensoundcontrol.org/schemas as a good location for people to post descriptions of OSC schemas that they use, and conveyed a vision of a rich repertoire of past OSC schemas and critiques of them.  This is sort of "zeroth-order" standardization, in the sense that it supports compatibility between OSC implementations on a completely decentralized, volunteer basis, with nobody making any global decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
     I was hoping that everybody with a laptop could actually try out the new web site as well as post some useful OSC schemas online, by having lots of people "add child page"  to  http://www.opensoundcontrol.org/schemas, but it turned out that we had a problem with the wireless network and so that plan was not possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     I mentioned that it would be nice to have a machine-readable representation of things like units and legal ranges of parameters, and people suggested both XML and RDF (part of the "semantic web") as possible technologies for this.
    </p>
    <p>
     Action items: research this topic, make prototype implementations, decide which attributes of an OSC schema can be machine-readable and which must be specified in natural language, enable OSC developers to write the machine-readable bits.
    </p>
    <p>
     Somebody suggested that it would also be nice to have guidelines for creating OSC schemas, so I later made this page:  http://www.opensoundcontrol.org/guidelines/address-spaces (as part of a more general http://www.opensoundcontrol.org/guidelines effort).  Again, these are just suggestions, not enforceable standards of any kind.
    </p>
    <p>
     The next level of standardization is a concept that JazzMutant calls "OSC Classes" (by analogy to classes in object oriented programming languages) and which I prefer to call "OSC Templates" (by analogy with Java Templates, which in my opinion they resemble more than they resemble classes).  The idea is a standardized OSC sub-schema, i.e., message names and semantics for one piece of an address tree.  So, for example,  we could imagine an OSC class/template for "lowpass filter", which would specify a few message names, semantics, and tree structure to represent the parameters of lowpass filters in general, i.e.,  cutoff frequency, Q, gain, etc.  The vision is that these would start out as the OSC sub-schema used by some particular implementation(s), then shared on  http://www.opensoundcontrol.org/schemas, then, once widely accepted (by the members of an ongoing working group?), adopted as a standard.   Afterwards, if my application used lowpass filters, I would have the option of implementing the standard OSC class/template for each of them.  Then if your application has a way to control lowpass filters in general, it will work in a "plug and play" fashion with mine.
    </p>
    <p>
     Action items: Pick a satisfactory name for "OSC Classes" aka "OSC Templates",  decide about JazzMutant's proposed framework for naming these, and form a working group to start the process of standardizing specific ones.
    </p>
    <h2>
     Discovery of schemas and address spaces
    </h2>
    <p>
     I briefly reviewed the history of the desire for an address space discovery query mechanism, and then we all read a new proposal for this by the JazzMutant folks.  I made this example to illustrate the proposed protocol (based on the trivial made-up address space from http://www.opensoundcontrol.org/schemas):
    </p>
    <p>
     <code>
      <br>
      Client			Server
      <br>
      /				/foo/, /bar/, /global/
      <br>
      /foo/			/foo/, amp, freq
      <br>
      /foo/amp format?	/foo/amp/ ",f" ",i"
      <br>
     </code>
    </p>
    <p>
     It was noted that the use of special keywords in place of the usual type tag string was somewhat radical and non-backwards compatible.
    </p>
    <p>
     Action item:  The JazzMutant people volunteered to prototype their system on the Lemur to demo address + format string discovery.  We assume that implementation experience from this project will result in a refinement of the proposal and/or increased acceptance.
    </p>
    <p>
     David Wessel proposed a standard description language for an OSC module to suggest a 2D WIMP UI for controlling it, somewhat analogous to the way that most Pd and Max/MSP objects come with a help patch showing a sample usage.  The obvious question this raises, which we did not resolve, was the reference model for the set of widgets that would be assumed by such a mechanism.  (Using Pd patches for this was floated as a non-serious suggestion.) The JazzMutant people showed us the XML language that they use internally (by sending it over OSC) to describe the layout of buttons, sliders, and other graphical elements on the Lemur, examples of which can be downloaded from http://www.jazzmutant.com/support_download.php  That particular XML language, of course, is specific to their product, but the examples show that XML can solve this type of problem.  It was pointed out that it would be nice for the UI description to be alongside parameter units, ranges, etc
    </p>
    <p>
     Action items: specify a particular set of widgets, decide about XML, and design the query language.
    </p>
    <h2>
     Discovery via ZeroConf
    </h2>
    <p>
     I began by talking through http://www.opensoundcontrol.org/discovery
    </p>
    <p>
     My lack of a pointer to sample code for ZeroConf on Windows led people to point out that "mDNS responder" for all three platforms includes Windows source code.  The Code for mDNSResponder (requires an Apple ID if you haven't it yet) which uses Apple Open Source License.
     <br>
     <a href="http://developer.apple.com/opensource/internet/bonjour.html" rel="nofollow">
      http://developer.apple.com/opensource/internet/bonjour.html
     </a>
    </p>
    <p>
     People shared the existence of two non-Apple-license implementations of ZeroConf:
    </p>
    <p>
     Howl (LGPL) (now discontinued in favor of...)
     <br>
     AVAHI (LGPL):
     <a href="http://www.avahi.org/" rel="nofollow">
      http://www.avahi.org
     </a>
    </p>
    <p>
     Action items:  update http://www.opensoundcontrol.org/discovery to make it easier for OSC developers to add ZeroConf to their software, add ZeroConf to more software, consider potential security issues.  Consult with Ross Bencina about OSCgroups in this context.
    </p>
    <h2>
     Queries for current state, etc.
    </h2>
    <p>
     http://www.opensoundcontrol.org/queries
     <br>
     At this point we had already covered queries related to OSC Schema discovery, so we briefly mentioned some of the other kinds of "current state of the OSC Server" queries that one might want to make.
    </p>
    <p>
     Action items: Form a query working group, implement and/or refine JazzMutant's  query protocol proposal, make a more formal proposal from the working group to the OSC community, standardize queries, help developers implement them.
    </p>
    <p>
     [Slightly past the 1-hour mark we took a short break.  Matt poured Glenfidditch for all who were so inclined.]
    </p>
    <h2>
     Binary File Format
    </h2>
    <p>
     There is a desire for a standard way to put OSC messages in a file, by analogy with MIDI files.  I pointed out three obvious facts:
    </p>
    <p>
     - OSC is already a binary format
    </p>
    <p>
     - OSC already has a convention of int32 size counts preceding each data item (both in bundles and in the recommended encoding for OSC packets over a continuous TCP stream), so we should probably do the same for a binary file format.
    </p>
    <p>
     - OSC bundles already have time tags, so we can use that mechanism instead of adding on time tags through another mechanism (as in MIDI files)
    </p>
    <p>
     Then I raised two questions:
    </p>
    <p>
     - OSC time tags are absolute, recording (e.g.) the time that a performance took place.  So an OSC sequencer that wanted to replay a stored OSC file would have to add an offset to all the time tags.
    </p>
    <p>
     - OSC performances may involve large numbers of clients and servers sending OSC packets to each other in an anarchic peer-to-peer architecture.  Should an OSC file record all of this traffic, or just traffic between a single pair?  It was pointed out that this is somewhat analogous to the type 0/1 MIDI file distinction.
    </p>
    <p>
     Action item: form a working group to resolve the questions.  Remy volunteered to be a part of this.
    </p>
    <h2>
     Vision for how unsophisticated users will have as-easy-as-possible mapping interfaces
    </h2>
    <p>
     Guillaume from JazzMutant said that OSC Schema discovery combined with Template/Class standardization would enable this.
    </p>
    <p>
     Remy Muller showed his OSCmap software, currently a work in progress, which is envisioned to query two OSC address schemas, display them side by side in a Finder-style tree structure (with disclosure triangles), and allow a user to set connections (e.g., between values sensed by sensors and control inputs to sound synthesis algorithms).  I suggested the Jack Audio and MIDI Patchbays as click+drag UIs that might be nice models for this.  OSCmap is currently GPL, but Remy is willing to consider a change to something like BSD if desired.
    </p>
    <p>
     Matt proposed a strange piece of software that would support the "MIDI learn" style of mapping input device parameters.  The assumption is that many sensor instrument might output lots of continuous parameters, and so there isn't always an analogue to "turn just the knob that should control such-and-such a parameter."  (E.g., with a 3D accelerometer, it's possible to move mainly in the X axis, but not possible to move exclusively in the X axis.)  So this software would keep track of a recent window of values received (by a collection of sensors) and output the OSC address of the one with the largest dynamic range in that time window.  So users could choose a mapping destination, then do the thing on their instrument (e.g., waving their accelerometer mostly in the X axis) that mainly affects the OSC message that the user wants to have control the given mapping destination.
    </p>
    <p>
     The importance of allowing users to have multiple different views on a single namespace was emphasized.
    </p>
    <h2>
     More efficient representation for type tag strings
    </h2>
    <p>
     JazzMutant proposed ",f[16]" as an abbreviation for ",ffffffffffffffff", plus a representation along the lines of C's "struct" using {} characters.  It was noted that this is a radical, non-backwards-compatible change, and the term "OSC 2.0" was mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
     Somebody asked about doing away with type tag strings entirely, once queries were standardized and widely implemented.  I replied that that was how OSC was originally designed and it caused a lot of problems.   The issue of polymorphism was even more convincing, with Sebastian Beaulieu (from Bidule) giving the example of a pull-down menu that can be set by sending the index of an item (as an int or a float) or the string that is the text of that item.
    </p>
    <p>
     Gunter Geiger wisely questioned the extent to which type tag parsing and representation is an actual bottleneck in practice.
    </p>
    <p>
     Action items: carefully study the struct-like part of the proposal,  try implementing this.  Since old-style format strings are still legal in the new system, the two can coexist as long as OSC Clients never send new-style type tag strings, so people can implement this and measure the change in performance on real systems
    </p>
    <h2>
     Proposal for super-efficient representation and recognition of address+type tag string
    </h2>
    <p>
     We reviewed the non-backwards-compatible proposal to compute a hash function on an OSC address and type tag string, e.g., a 32-bit or 64-bit CRC checksum, and to send that over the network instead.  This would reduce both bandwidth and the time to dispatch to a given address.  It probably would not work with OSC's pattern matching features.
    </p>
    <p>
     I made the analogy to C++ function name "mangling", which supports type polymorphism by considering a particular sequence of argument types to be a sort of suffix to a function's name.  It was suggested that this procedure might be used for just the address string
    </p>
    <p>
     Gunter Geiger wisely questioned the extent to which message dispatching and type tag parsing is an actual bottleneck in practice.
    </p>
    <p>
     I pointed out the way that SuperCollider Server accomplishes similar goals within the existing OSC standard (though not exactly in the spirit of the intended use of OSC address spaces)  by sending very short command names organized in a flat list, not implementing pattern matching, and representing particular message destinations as an integer argument instead of as the prefix part of message addresses.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was proposed that there be a sub-protocol (with a name such as "hardware OSC" or "OSC lite") for this.
    </p>
    <p>
     Action items:  Prototype this suggestion; decide what to do about pattern matching; consider how it will coexist peacefully with standard OSC, especially how clients would discover whether servers could accept these messages.
    </p>
    <h2>
     International Characters
    </h2>
    <p>
     Some people expressed a desire to allow international characters (e.g., European vowels) as both OSC String arguments and in OSC addresses.  The former seemed to be quite straightforward.  As for addresses, it was pointed out that some characters are already forbidden.  Some people wanted to keep things to just ASCII, others wanted to be able to present non-ASCII characters in user-visible address spaces.   Nothing was resolved on this question.
    </p>
    <h2>
     OSC working groups
    </h2>
    <p>
     I started by reviewing the call to form working groups that we made at the 2004 OSC conference:  http://www.opensoundcontrol.org/media/wright-working-groups.pdf
    </p>
    <p>
     We discussed the question of how proposals made by working groups would be reviewed by the entire OSC community, agreeing that it would be good for working groups to work on their work out details of a specific proposal in a more private forum, then share it with the OSC community in general.  I made the analogy to a greenhouse, where tender young seedlings are sheltered from the world until they grow up enough to be moved to an outside garden.
    </p>
    <p>
     We did not systematically define specific working groups, but people indicated topics that they'd be interested in working on:
    </p>
    <p>
     Adrian Freed (in absentia): hardware
     <br>
     Emmanuel Flety:  hardware
     <br>
     Whole JazzMutant team: queries, OSC lobbying (especially web design)
     <br>
     Sebastian Beaulieu (Bidule): queries, namespace changes
     <br>
     Remy Muller: general enthusiasm to participate
    </p>
    <p>
     Action items: actually form working groups, specify scope of each one, get things going on opensoundcontrol.org, etc.
