I am currently coordinating the OSC hardware working group. My first
tasks are recruit collaborators and to organize a clear definition of
the scope of work of the group. Here are some possible goals:

-   Develop an affordable (\<\$200) hardware kit analagous to the OSC
    Software Kit as a platform or inspiration for future embedded OSC.
    Some interesting new platforms need to be evaluated, e.g.,
    http://www.picotux.com/
-   Develop a standardized message vocabulary for embedded OSC,
    especially for sensor interface boxes: It would be useful to promote
    standard naming conventions for the parameters and units for the
    measurands. It would be interesting to include (subsume?) some of
    the Device Class Definition of HID:
    http://www.usb.org/developers/hidpage/. A good starting point for
    this activity might by documenting the OSC messgae format used by
    the p5OSC program: http://noisybox.net/computers/p5glove/.
-   Develop the hardware support for the clock distribution required for
    scheduling OSC messages accurately.
    Support the development and distribution of devices that employ OSC,
    e.g.\
