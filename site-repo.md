# The Git Repository Behind this Website

One way this website is "open" is that all the source files that
contain and create the site content are in a world-readable git
repository:

**<https://github.com/CNMAT/OpenSoundControl.org>**

Therefore you can:

- Clone the site for yourself to download and examine all the files.
- Browse the content of the site within github's website (e.g., [this
  file](https://github.com/CNMAT/OpenSoundControl.org/blob/master/site-repo.md)) -
  beware: the links are to html files but the repo contains only the
  md source files.
- [Contribute](contribute.html) to the site via a pull request (if you
  know what you're doing). Don't add html files or any
  implementations/*.md files because these are generated from other
  files.
- Keep your own copy or mirror of the site content.
