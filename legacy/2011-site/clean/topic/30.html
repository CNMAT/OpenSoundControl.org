  For those interested in the gory details: this site was developed by Andrew W. Schmeder  and Adrian Freed using the drupal content management system.
 </p>
 <p>
  We picked drupal because of its flexibility and especially its strong support for the collaborative workflow that we need to support the working group activity. An example of this is the drupal implementation of "wikis" ( "Books" in drupal terminology). With drupal any content such as a forum post can be integrated directly into books.
