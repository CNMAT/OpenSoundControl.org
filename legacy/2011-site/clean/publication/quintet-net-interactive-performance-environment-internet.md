               [ Abstract                         Quintet.net is an interactive network
     ]{.biblio-row-title}                         performance environment invented and
                                                  developed by composer and computer
                                                  musician Georg Hajdu. It enables
                                                  performers at up to five locations to
                                                  play music over the Internet under the
                                                  control of a \"conductor.\" The
                                                  environment, which was programmed with
                                                  the graphical programming language
                                                  Max/MSP, consists of five components: a
                                                  Server, a Client, a Conductor, a Listener
                                                  and a Viewer. These components exchange
                                                  data using Matt Wrightâ€™s
                                                  OpenSoundControl (OSC) and otudp Max
                                                  external objects. Quintet.net was
                                                  conceived in 1999, soon after CNMAT made
                                                  these objects publicly available.\
                                                  \
                                                  The players interact over the Internet by
                                                  sending control streams to the Server
                                                  containing data that comes from a pitch
                                                  tracker, MIDI, or simply the computer
                                                  keyboard. On the Server, the streams are
                                                  copied, processed, and sent back to the
                                                  Clients as well as to the Listeners. In
                                                  addition, a conductor can log onto the
                                                  server and control the musical outcome by
                                                  changing settings remotely and sending
                                                  streams of parameter values as well as
                                                  short instructions to the players.\
                                                  \
                                                  Quintet.net uses a sampler or MIDI for
                                                  instrumental playback. It also features
                                                  granular synthesis as well as VST
                                                  plug-ins for sound processing and
                                                  playback, and has additional video and
                                                  graphical properties, which permit better
                                                  interaction and control on a symbolic
                                                  level: The performers along with the
                                                  audience see the music which the
                                                  participants produce on screen in
                                                  \"space\" notation on five grand staves.
                                                  In addition, video clips and/or live
                                                  video can be displayed by the Viewer
                                                  add-on and mixed with real-time music
                                                  notation for an enhanced viewing
                                                  experience. The Conductor can also read
                                                  musical scores and send parts to the
                                                  performers, which will be displayed along
                                                  with the notes produced by the
                                                  musicians.\
                                                  \
                                                  The music performed with Quintet.net is a
                                                  combination of composed and improvised
                                                  elements. The lack of real synchronicity
                                                  (because of network latency) necessitates
                                                  the adaptation of a genuine \"Internet\"
                                                  performance style for which John Cage\'s
                                                  number pieces could be considered a
                                                  model: These pieces require certain notes
                                                  or phrases to be played within \"time
                                                  brackets.\"\
                                                  \
                                                  Recently, a composition development kit,
                                                  including several visual editors, was
                                                  added in order to facilitate the creation
                                                  of pieces for the environment. Several
                                                  pieces have specifically been written for
                                                  the Quintet.net and successfully
                                                  performed in high-profile venues.
