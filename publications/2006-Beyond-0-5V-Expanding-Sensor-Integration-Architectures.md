Adrian Freed, Rimas Avizienis, Matthew Wright. *Beyond 0-5V: Expanding Sensor Integration Architectures*. 2006.  New Interfaces for Musical Expression. 

**URL**: <http://www.adrianfreed.com/content/beyond-0-5v-expanding-sensor-integration-architectures>

**Abstract**:  A new sensor integration system and its first incarnation is described. As well as supporting existing analog sensor arrays a new architecture allows for easy integration of the new generation of low-cost digital sensors used in computer music performance instruments and installation art. 

**Context**: Adrian Freed kindly provided a parseable collection of OSC-related papers from his website, ported to the new site by Matt Wright in May 2021
