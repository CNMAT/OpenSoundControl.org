The implementation of the concept in a project called micro-OSC is described. Other sensor interfacing products are evaluated in the context of DIY prototyping of musical instruments. The capabilities of the micro-OSC platform are demonstrated through a set of examples including  resistive sensing, mixed digital-analog systems, many-channel sensor interfaces and time-based measurement methods.

An analysis  shows that jitter-induced noise with dispersion over the  millisecond range significantly degrades real-time highresolution  sensor signal streams. The design of a  distributed clock synchronization and event scheduling  domain over an asynchronous network is described. A  realization of this model is presented, created using the  new micro-OSC (uOSC) hardware platform and host  software components in MaxMSP. An OSC address  schema for client-server clock synchronization is  documented. Two new objects for MaxMSP are  introduced: OSC-timetag and OSC-schedule.

The software is designed with considerations for integration in new musical interfaces and embedded devices. Features of note include stateless design, efficient floating-point support, temporally correct data handling, and protocol completeness. The hardware/software combination is compared to other solutions. A performance analysis is conducted to quantify the latency characteristics under realistic conditions.

Each of the touchpads supports a three dimensional representation of musical material: two spatial dimensions plus a force measurement we typically use to control dynamics.  Our system uses 24 pads laid out in a ?brick wall? style array that fits nicely under the two hands.  We emphasize the treatment of gestures as sub-sampled audio signals.  This tight coupling of gesture with audio provides for a high degree of control intimacy.

Control can be improved through the use of Open Sound Control by developing a flexible name space that employs multiple, intuitive parameter names (and aliases), higher-level controls and range mapping, simplifying control for the user. We will demonstrate these ideas with Max/MSP patches that repackage VST plug-ins in a more usable way and also introduce the idea that plug-in interfaces themselves can be improved by building in a well-formed OSC name space.

OSW allows users to develop at different levels, including visual patching, XML editing, scripting and high-level C++. Components called transforms are combined to form programs called patches.  The set of included transforms can be extended using the ?Externalizer,? a tool for writing high-level specifications of new transforms.

We explain how the additional functionality can be obtained at a lower cost than existing keyboard controllers and demonstrate a prototype to illustrate this analysis. Our new keyboard uses optical interruption sensing for each key and hybrid space and time multiplexing to achieve the requisite scan rates.

CNMAT has developed a solution using the ubiquitous 100BaseT Ethernet that supports up to 10 channels of 24-bit audio, 64 channels of sample-synchronous control-rate gesture data, and 4 precisely time-stamped MIDI I/O streams. Latency measurements show that we can get signals into and back out of Max/MSP in under 7 milliseconds.   The central component in the device is a field programmable gate array (FPGA).   In addition to providing a variety of computer interface capabilities, the device can function as a cross-coder for a variety of protocols including GMICS.  This paper outlines the motivation, design, and implementation of the connectivity processor.

In OSW, components called "transforms" are dynamically configured into larger units called "patches."  New components can be expressed using familiar mathematical definitions without deep knowledge of C++. High-level specifications of transforms are created using the "Externalizer," and are compiled and loaded into a running OSW environment. The data used by transforms can have any valid C++ type. OSW uses a reactive real-time scheduler that safely and efficiently handles multiple processors, time sources and synchronous data flows.

The needs for temporal synchronization and dynamic range of audio control data are described in terms of accuracy, precision, bit-depth, bit-rate, and sampling frequency. Specic details are given for the case of instrumental gesture control, spatial audio control and synthesis algorithm control. The consideration of various transport mechanisms used with OSC is discussed for datagram, serial and isochronous modes. A summary of design approaches for describing audio control data is shown, and the case is argued that multi-layered information-rich representations that support multiple strategies for describing semantic structure are necessary.

It embeds a small expression language en-abling writing and execution of programs in OSC structures. We present recent works and experiments using this framework in the OpenMusic computer-aided composition environment. This inte-gration of programming in data transfer protocols enables original experiments with structured communication in media systems: pro-gram snippets can be distributed as OSC messages, which evaluate to further OSC messages in the different communicating software packages. We illustrate via case studies some advantages of such integrated system in terms of the functional expressivity, as well as the ef?ciency gained in the communication through declarative functional descriptions embedded in the transferred data.

Despite the importance of accurate timing in music, there are relatively few widely-applicable synchronisation solutions available to computer music practitioners. In this paper we present a simple OSC-based synchronisation method for wired and wireless applications, whichis designed to be easy to apply and is shown to offer accuracy appropriate for fine-grained music applications. The proposed solution relies on a single master sending a synchronisation message to all slaves. Empirical studies witha heterogeneous network of 17 Wi-Fi slaves and five Ethernet slaves demonstrate that each homogeneous group is able to achieve a relative synchronisation accuracy of 166 us and 100 us respectively, offset from the master time by their respective network latencies. An acoustic localisation system isimplemented to demonstrate an application that requires both accurate synchronisation and benefits from wireless connectivity. The system is shown to precisely locate a sound source with a standard deviation of 1.8 mm.
