## Control of VST plug-ins using OSC

::: {.content}
These examples were exerpted from [a paper by Michael Zbyszynski and
Adrian Freed presented at ICMC in

#### 1. INTRODUCTION {#introduction style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.0pt;margin-left:
1.4pt"}

While audio plug-ins are extremely useful, limitations of their control
structure can make them unwieldy to use. Specifically, the name space of
each VST plug-in \[1\] is flat and populated by parameter names that
have been carefully chosen by the designers of the plug-in, but do not
necessarily represent the terminology or language preferred by the user.
Parameter names are mapped through a generic range (0. to 1.) without
informing the user about the mapping range or the specific units that
are employed inside the plug-in, and each message controls only one
parameter.

Through the use of Open Sound Control (OSC) \[2\], a flexible name space
can be developed that employs multiple, intuitive parameter names (and
aliases), higher-level controls and range mapping, simplifying control
for the user. We will demonstrate these ideas with Max/MSP patches that
repackage VST plug-ins in a more usable way and also introduce the idea
that plug-in interfaces themselves can be improved by building in a
well-formed OSC name space. We will also suggest ways (e.g., atomicity
and queries) that control could be further improved if the plug-in could
be controlled directly with OSC.

In addition to creating a more useable control structure, careful use of
the OSC abstractions proposed here will allow composers and performers
to create more fully documented works than can be easily updated with
changing technologies. A thoughtfully designed name space can separate
the musical intention from the particular plug-in, allowing composers to
adapt and repurpose pieces as plug-ins evolve.

[ Many audio processing plug-ins fall into typical categories, such as
dynamics processors or reverbs. Each specific user has expectations for
the names of the parameters in an archetypical reverb, for instance,
which are determined by that user's technical and linguistic background.
Where one user might expect a parameter called "Wet Level," another
might be more familiar with "Reverb Gain." Users must adapt to the
naming scheme of the plug-in designer. This complicates the use of
multiple plug-ins from disparate sources; the user must constantly
change naming schemes to do something as simple as auditioning multiple
reverbs with similar parameter settings. ]{lang="EN-GB"

[ The use of a rich OSC name space provides the opportunity for multiple
aliases to the same parameter. An intelligent naming scheme would direct
both "Wet Level" and "Reverb Gain" to the same parameter, allowing the
user to focus on the specifics of controlling the sound. If the user
changes reverb plug-ins, they could continue with their preferred naming
scheme for the generic parameters. They could concentrate on the sonic
differences between reverb algorithms, rather then the naming
idiosyncrasies of each design. ]{lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:

[ Another advantage to a carefully designed name space would come when
documenting, preserving, or reconstructing a finished musical work.
Because the musician's original sonic intent would be represented in a
form that was not tied to a specific plug-in technology, it could be
easily understood and adapted to suit the situation of future
technologies. When a piece travels or is revisited, explicitly
descriptive parameter names, such as "Reverb Gain," are more easily
interpreted than opaque names, such as "Mix" or Mode." ]{lang="EN-GB"

The next step in an intelligent plug-in control scheme would be to
address parameters in established units. All VST parameters are
currently mapped to the range of 0.0 to 1.0, effectively obscuring the
values being controlled. Furthermore, a particular user might prefer
setting crossover frequencies in Hertz or MIDI cents, and might prefer
percentages to decibels as a unit of loudness. In addition to parameter
name aliases, parameters could be addressed in specific units. For
example "Wet Level 63%" or "Reverb Gain --6dB." By accommodating
specific user's predilections, plug-ins would become more intuitively
useable.

The naming space for VST plug-ins is flat, simply a list of parameters
that could be addressed. While this might be adequate for plug-ins with
a few parameters, some plug-ins (e.g. Waves Parametric Convolution
Reverb \[3\]) can have dozens of parameters. In such a case, it makes
sense to organize parameters in a hierarchical name space. For instance,
a multiband compressor will have many crossover frequencies. These could
be addressed as "/crossover/low\<-\>mid *n* " and
"/crossover/mid\<-\>high *n* " (or, depending on the user,
"/crossover/middle\<-\>hi *n* [ " or "/x-over/m\<-\>h
]{style="font-style:normal"} *n* [ "). Such a naming scheme would help
keep the control structure clear and comprehensible.
]{style="font-style:normal"}

The ability to reorganize parameters in a clear hierarchy would have
special significance in to users working with assistive technologies.
For example, blind users working with screen readers could customize
their name space to quickly navigate to the most pertinent parameters,
rather than waiting to read through a long list of all possibilities.

[ A carefully designed hierarchical name space would allow the user
leverage OSC's use of pattern matching. \[4\] Following the example of a
multiband compressor, the compression thresholds might be named
"/low/threshold *n* ]{style="font-size:10.0pt"} [ ," /middle/threshold
*n* ]{style="font-size:10.0pt"} [ ," and "/high/threshold *n*
]{style="font-size:10.0pt"} [ ." In the OSC Address Pattern, "\*"
matches any sequence of zero or more characters. This would allow the
user to simultaneously adjust all thresholds by sending the message
"/\*/threshold *n* ]{style="font-size:10.0pt"} [ ."

Another advantage of a careful created OSC name space would the use
higher-level names that control multiple parameters. In the example the
context of multi-band compression, the user might be given explicit
control of the cut-off frequencies between the low, middle, and high
bands. Alternatively, the user could prefer to control the center
frequency and bandwidth of the middle band. With OSC, these high-level
parameter names could be created to adjust the appropriate crossover
frequencies accordingly.

The following examples were programmed in Max/MSP following the name
space design guidelines suggest above. The first demonstrates a control
structure for controlling two reverb plug-ins (mda Freeverb \[5\] and
Griesinger 2.2 by Nathan Wolek \[6\]), each with different parameter
names.

This name space was designed to enable the user to switch between the
reverb plug-ins while maintaining a consistent control structure.
Similar parameters in each plug-in are addressed with the same name. For
instance, "Reverblevel" addresses "Wetlevel" in the Freeverb and
"reverbgain" in the Griesinger reverb. The example also suggests the
possibility of aliases and unconventional terminology; "slimeyness" is
also mapped to "Wetlevel" and "reverbgain."

The namespace for controlling a multiband compressor (mda MultiBand
\[7\]) is much more complicated, especially in its use of aliases. It
also includes higer level parameters that influence more than one of the
plug-in's built in parameters.

**Table 2.** Name space for multiband compressor patch

The first group of names address single plug-in parameters, and
demonstrate multiple naming possibilities for the same parameter.
Different users might prefer "Hi" to "high," or simply "H." This space
could be expanded to include other aliases for language localization.
Additionally, the parameters "/\*/\[dbcomp, dBcomp\]" and
"/\*/\[dboutput, dBoutput\]" employ real units, decibels instead of the
generic range of 0. to 1. They are mapped accordingly in the max patch
before being sent to the plug-in. Other units of loudness or intensity
could be added, each with their own mapping.

The second pair of names are higher-level parameters. They allow the
user to directly control the center frequency and bandwidth of the
middle compression band, implicitly influence all three bands. The OSC
parameter value is translated into the proper crossover frequencies for
both the low to middle and the middle to high crossover, and forwarded
to the plug-ins built in parameters.

The final group of generalized parameters includes another example of
real units, setting the crossover frequencies in Hertz.

The patch, below, also uses OSC's pattern matching abilities. To adjust
all of the output gains simultaneously and in decibles, the user sends
the message: "/?/dboutput *n* [ ." Variants of this message using other
aliases are also available. ]{style="font-size:10.0pt"}
