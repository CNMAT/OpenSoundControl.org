## Supported type tags in CNMAT OpenSoundControl external in max/msp

::: {.content}
Does the CNMAT OpenSoundControl external support 64-bit double precision
floats?

according to this link, it does, but I have had no luck getting any
output sending it an\
osc message with a \"d\" in it.

http://opensoundcontrol.org/implementation/opensoundcontrol-maxmsp

Is the source code for this external available anywhere? I would ideally
like to dig into it and see what format it\
expects a double in, (endianess etc), if at all.

I\'ve done a fair bit of googling, and digging around on the CNMAT
website,\
but can\'t find any more information about it.

Thanks,\
xks
