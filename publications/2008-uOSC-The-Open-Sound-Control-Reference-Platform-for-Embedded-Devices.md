**Abstract**:  A general-purpose firmware for a low-cost microcontroller is described that employs the Open Sound Control protocol over USB. The software is designed with considerations for integration in new musical interfaces and embedded devices. Features of note include stateless design, efficient floating-point support, temporally correct data handling, and protocol completeness. The hardware/software combination is compared to other solutions. A performance analysis is conducted to quantify the latency characteristics under realistic conditions. 

**Context**: Adrian Freed kindly provided a parseable collection of OSC-related papers from his website, ported to the new site by Matt Wright in May 2021
