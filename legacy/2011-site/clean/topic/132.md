## Implementing OSC in C++

::: {.content}
I have developed a camera based motion detectori in C++ under Windows.\
First version of the app sent data to its clients via MIDI.\
Current version does the same using a proprietary protocol via TCP.\
Now I want to move to UDP, and OSC seems a good opportunity to use an
open protocolo, instead of implementing another proprietary protocol.\
I have two questions:\
- Where should start from? Is there an useful online source?\
- I\'ll need to monitor the data sent by my app in OSC form, of course:
which readymade application should I try?\
Tanks for your attention
