**Abstract**: The design space of fabric multitouch surface interaction is explored with emphasis on novel materials and construction techniques aimed towards reliable, repairable pressure sensing surfaces for musical applications.

**Context**: Adrian Freed kindly provided a parseable collection of OSC-related papers from his website, ported to the new site by Matt Wright in May 2021
