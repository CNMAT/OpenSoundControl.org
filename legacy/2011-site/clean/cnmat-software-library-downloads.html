  CNMAT's open-source
  <a href="http://www.cnmat.berkeley.edu/OpenSoundControl/src/libOSC/">
   library for constructing OSC
  packets
  </a>
  :  This is all you need if you want your application to be able
  to format OSC packets for sending over the network.

 <p>
  CNMAT's sendOSC and dumpOSC programs: The Unix program
  <a href="http://www.cnmat.berkeley.edu/OpenSoundControl/clients/sendOSC.html">
   sendOSC
  </a>
  allows the user to type in message addresses 
  and arguments via a no-frills text interface, and formats and sends these messages 
  to the desired IP address and port number. The Unix program
  <a href="http://www.cnmat.berkeley.edu/OpenSoundControl/dumpOSC.html">
   dumpOSC
  </a>
  listens for OpenSoundControl messages on the given port and prints them out 
  in a simple ASCII format. It's a very useful tool for client debugging.
  <a href="http://www.cnmat.berkeley.edu/OpenSoundControl/src">
   Source code

  </font>
  <font face="Times" size="2">
   implements as many of the features of an OSC-addressable application as possible. (We have also made available a library that constructs OSC via a procedural interface that hides the OSC byte format.) The following issues are handled internally and need not concern users of the Kit: byte format of OSC, time tags and scheduling of messages in the future, atomicity of messages with the same time tag, pattern matching, memory management of OSC objects, and automatic answering of certain queries.

  <p>
   The Kit is available as both C and C++ libraries. The APIs use an object-oriented style with opaque objects; the C version represents objects as pointers to structs. All communication between the Kit and the rest of the application is via arguments and return values; the interface does not use global variables.
  </p>

 <h3>
  3. Interface to OSC-addressable features
 </h3>
 <font face="Times" size="2">
  <p>
   OSC is a tool that is useful only insofar as there are interesting features that can be controlled by it. Therefore, the Kit's API for making features controllable via OSC is designed to be as straightforward and convenient as possible. This paper will use the term "user" to refer to the OSC client, presumably a musician, who controls some feature via OSC, and "implementor" to refer to the programmer who implements that feature and makes it OSC-addressable.
  </p>
  <p>
   The hierarchical OSC address space is modeled as an object-oriented tree of
   <i>
    containers
   </i>
   , each of which contains subcontainers (for tree structure) and
   <i>
    methods
   </i>
   , which can implement the actions that OSC messages call for, e.g., updating the value of a parameter. A container's methods and subcontainers share a single namespace.  The root of this tree, corresponding to the address "/," is returned by the procedure that initializes the address space. All operations on this tree, including adding or removing a container or method, are O(1) and can be performed dynamically with no risk of compromising reactive real-time performance.
  </p>
  <p>
   Each method contains a
   <i>
    callback procedure,
   </i>
   written by the implementor, which the Kit will invoke at the time that the OSC message is to take effect. The arguments to a callback procedure are:

   The OSC Kit automatically detects the standard OSC queries and generates a response.  The raw data needed as the answer to queries like "what are the argument types for this message" or "give me the documentation for this feature" are provided by the implementor when registering containers and methods.

  4. Interfaces for Adding OSC to a Real-Time System
 </h3>
 <font face="Times" size="2">
  <p>
   There are many ways that the OSC Kit needs to tie into the rest of a reactive realtime system. It must interact with the network services to send and receive packets. It interacts with the scheduler and control flow of the overall real-time system to ensure that the Kit has enough time to process incoming messages but that it defers processing of messages scheduled to occur in the future until the system has some otherwise idle time. Finally, the Kit needs memory to store the address space hierarchy and to receive and process incoming messages; this memory must be available dynamically in real-time, but the Kit does not assume that the real-time system will necessarily have a real-time memory allocator.
  </p>
  <p>
   All of these interfaces were designed with the following goals:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Minimal assumptions about what the rest of the system will look like
   </li>
   <li>
    Maximum real-time performance
   </li>
   <li>
    Simplicity and ease of use
   </li>
   <li>
    Maximum flexibility to change underlying implementations in the future (e.g., for performance optimization) without breaking code written to the API
   </li>
  </ul>
 </font>
 <h4>
  4.1 Interface to low-level networking code
 </h4>
 <p>
  <font face="Times" size="2">
   Network services are usually provided by the operating system via an API. These APIs generally expect to be given a buffer of memory in which to place incoming data from the network. So the OSC Kit manages a pool of PacketBuffer objects that consist mainly of a large buffer for this purpose. (They also store an implementation-dependent network return address.) The Kit never copies OSC data in memory; OSC data is parsed in the PacketBuffer, and eventually a number of callback procedures are invoked with
  </font>
  <tt>
   args
  </tt>
  <font face="Times" size="2">
   values that point into the PacketBuffer. Because an OSC packet may contain time-tagged messages to take effect in the future, these PacketBuffers cannot be reused until the last message in the packet takes effect.
  </font>
 </p>
 <h4>
  4.2 Control Flow/Scheduling Model
 </h4>
 <font face="Times" size="2">
  <p>
   The Kit does not include its own scheduler; we assume that the design and implementation of the main part of the sound processing application will determine the overall flow of control. The OSC Kit does its work when the main part of the application calls procedures in the Kit's scheduling API. Low-latency digital sound processing requires a scheduling model in which code to compute output samples is run frequently, leaving many short periods of time for the processor to do other things like process OSC input. Therefore, the Kit's scheduling API is based on the assumption that its procedures will be called often and that they should do a small amount of work and return quickly.
  </p>
  <p>
   Here is a gross approximation of the inner loop of an OSC-addressable sound synthesizer:
  </p>
 </font>
 <p>
 </p>
 <pre>
  while (1) {
    OSCTimeTag now = GetCurrentTime();
    while (WeHaveEnoughTimeToInvokeMessages()) {
        if (!OSCInvokeMessagesThatAreReady(now)) break;
    }
    SynthesizeSomeSound();
    while (NetworkPacketWaiting()) {
        OSCPacketBuffer p = OSCAllocPacketBuffer();
        if (!p) {
            Bummer();
        } else {
            NetworkReceivePacket(p);
            OSCAcceptPacket(p);
        }
    }
    while (TimeLeftBeforeWeHaveDoSomething()) {
        if (!OSCBeProductiveWhileWaiting()) break;
    }
}
 </pre>
 <p>
  <tt>
   OSCAcceptPacket
  </tt>
  <font face="Times" size="2">
   "accepts" a newly received packet. When a time tag indicates a message that needs to happen immediately (or should already have happened), it has no choice but to process it immediately: parse, pattern-match the address pattern against the addresses in the current hierarchy, and invoke the necessary callback procedures. When a bundle's time tag indicates a time still in the future, there is time between receipt of the bundle and when it must be executed. In this case,
  </font>
  <tt>
   OSCAcceptPacket
  </tt>
  <font face="Times" size="2">
   defers all work, inserting the bundle into the priority queue of messages to be invoked in the future. This queue uses a standard heap data structure [Bentley 86] with O(log(n)) insertion and deletion, but it is easy for the implementor to create a custom queue, e.g., to take advantage of knowing that the main scheduler always operates on fixed-size time blocks [Dannenberg 89].
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <tt>
   OSCBeProductiveWhileWaiting
  </tt>
  <font face="Times" size="2">
   performs a small amount of "background" processing on messages in the queue. The idea is to invoke this procedure when the processor would otherwise be idle. (In a thread-based system, a low-priority thread would continuously call this procedure.) This procedure's return value indicates whether there is more work to do, so it can be called as many times as possible during these idle times.
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <tt>
   OSCInvokeMessagesThatAreReady
  </tt>
  <font face="Times" size="2">
   takes the current time as an argument, and invokes the callbacks whose time has arrived. (This is the Kit's only interface to the part of the system that knows what time it is.) This should be called frequently to ensure low control latency. Atomicity is guaranteed by this procedure, because it invokes all of the callbacks with a particular time tag before returning. (In a thread-based system, the thread invoking the callbacks must prevent the audio-generating thread from running until
  </font>
  <tt>
   OSCInvokeMessagesThatAreReady
  </tt>
  <font face="Times" size="2">
   returns.)
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Times" size="2">
   We have integrated the OSC Kit into a real-time system running under IRIX and based upon the
  </font>
  <tt>
   select()
  </tt>
  <font face="Times" size="2">
   system call. An example application using this arrangement is available for download. We have also designed a thread-based architecture using the Kit, with separate threads for accepting incoming packets, background processing , producing the list of callback procedures that are ready to be invoked , and invoking callback procedures. Pseudocode for the thread design is also available for download.
  </font>
 </p>
 <h4>
  4.3 Memory Model
 </h4>
 <font face="Times" size="2">
  <p>
   The OSC system needs dynamic memory allocation for the address space, for PacketBuffers, for the priority queue, and for lists of methods that match address patterns. To avoid the problems associated with real-time memory management, the OSC Kit preallocates pools of fixed size memory chunks for each of these objects. A very fast custom memory manager provides O(1) allocation and freeing via these pools. Users of the Kit pass arguments to the initialization procedures that say how many of each kind of object to allocate.
  </p>
  <p>
   The Kit does not expose implementation details like the contents of these data structures, so in order for users of the Kit to decide how many objects to preallocate we provide a procedure that takes the same arguments as the initialization procedure and returns the number of bytes of memory that would be allocated.
  </p>
 </font>
 <p>
  <font face="Times" size="2">
   Initialization procedures also take two function pointers as arguments: a pointer to the "initialization-time memory allocator" and a pointer to the "real-time memory allocator." Both of these procedures, like
  </font>
  <tt>
   malloc()
  </tt>
  <font face="Times" size="2">
   , take a number of bytes as argument and return a pointer to that much free memory. The Kit invokes the initialization-time allocator only from the initialization procedure. It invokes the real-time allocator if any of the preallocated object pools runs out. If the real-time allocator fails, the Kit has to drop a message, refuse to add to the address space, or otherwise fail in a graceful manner. If a system does not have real-time memory allocation, the real-time allocator can simply be a procedure that always returns 0. Because the memory allocator used by the kit is an argument rather than an internal procedure, it is possible to tune the memory system without recompiling the Kit.
  </font>
 </p>
 <font face="Times" size="2">
  <p>
   Although much more sophisticated designs would be possible, this system performs well and allows for the important case of static overall memory limits. The ability to convert free memory for one kind of object into needed memory for another kind of object could avoid certain "not enough memory" situations, but managing pools of different-sized objects would drastically increase the complexity of the memory allocator.
