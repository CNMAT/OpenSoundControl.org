      This paper reports our recent developments on sensor acquisition systems, using computer network technology. We present a versatile hardware system that can be connected to wireless modules, Analog to Digital Converters, and enables Ethernet communication. We are planning to make freely available the design of this architecture. We describe also several approaches we tested for wireless communication. Such technology developments are currently used in our newly formed Performance Arts Technology Group.

     1. INTRODUCTION
     <br>
     Gesture sensing (controllers, augmented instruments, body gestures) requires accurate sampling and low latency, especially for the direct control of sound parameters with high-resolution control. Our design strategy is to develop an acquisition platform with high-quality digitization that can be used in several distinct configurations: from sensing the gesture of musicians to tracking the movements of several dancers. A particular implementation of this design, the EtherSense will be commercially available shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
     As discussed in [1] we found that most commercial acquisition systems were unsatisfactory for the increasingly complex sensing technology needed for performance arts. However Network Technology offers nowadays interesting opportunities while OSC rises as a standard. At the same time, network technolgy has key features in the context of live performance, such as long cable support, fast data-rate and robustness
    </p>
    <p>
     2. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
     <br>
     Our goal was to build a versatile system suitable for gesture research, allowing us to experiment and to prototype with various sensors systems. The main requirement was to use a hardware base comparable to a fully manufactured and ready-to-use product. Therefore, we decided to separate the Ethernet and OSC functions from a set of various application modules, including for example wireless receptors, digitizers, digital-to-analog converters and relays. We thus opted for a Mother Board (Ethernet & OSC) / Daughter Board (DB) architecture as described by figure 1.
    </p>
    <p>
     A simple Q&A protocol layer allows for the communication between the mother and the daughter boards. These latter ones can be for example multiple channel digitizers, DACs, PWM servo controllers or a custom mix of several functions (up to 16 boards can be connected on the same bus).
    </p>
    <p>
     A DB transmits its contents on the motherâ€™s request, with custom sampling period, which can be defined for each DB (a 1400 Hz sample rate  can be achieved with a single card ON).
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
     Digitized data is then inserted as a integer list into the OSC buffer with an OSC address related to the concerned MB and DB like /Ethersense04/DB02 [16 int. list].
    </p>
    <p>
     Data routing and unpacking can be therefore easily achieved on the host computer. The Ethersense is composed of two 16 channel 16 bit digitizing daughter boards. External 15 pin DSub connectors allow direct sensor connection and export power supply while a D-Sub to Â¼â€� jack pig tail connector make sensor experiments easy.
    </p>
    <p>
     3. WIRELESS PROTOTYPES
     <br>
     Dance performances need wireless portable equipment. The main challenge is to allow several performers to be equiped with sensors while FCC regulations make large spectrum radio frequency broadcast difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
     WiFi was the next logical step for experimenting high-speed wireless network solutions. WiFi adapters are now embedded in most laptops or can be added to a computer. Note that 802.11 is not Ethernet per se, it is a wireless hardware and protocol standard. However, it has been designed to transport Ethernet: sending OSC through WiFi is straightforward. WiFi has also features 13 channels with 5 non-overlapping ones. Current experiments showed that 5 digitizing terminal could share the same channel at a 5ms transmission rate. Still at experimental stage, we have successfully tested the unit with dancers equipped with accelerometers and flexion sensors.
    </p>
    <p>
     5. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
     <br>
     The general performance of the acquisition system architecture is excellent. Overall these developments are very promising.
    </p>
    <p>
     We have designed custom DBs that can be connected to our OSC board, such as two measurement cards for an augmented violin with accelerometers.
    </p>
    <p>
     The WiFi prototype now has an embedded LCD and an autonomy of 1h35 with alkaline AAA batteries. Rechargeable ones can be also used and an external AA battery pack might extend the autonomy to 3 or 4 hours.
