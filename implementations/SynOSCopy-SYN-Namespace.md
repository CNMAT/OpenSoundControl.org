## Description

This is a proposal for a standardized namespace within OSC. <p> Its main application is for controlling Synthesizers, therefore the name "SYN". <p> It should have all the possibilities of MIDI (except MIDI show control and similar exotic functions - unless necessary) and beyond. It is not an "OSC-wrapped MIDI protocol" but a completely new system which has no concern for 7bit MIDI messages.

## Implementation Details

**Platform(s)**: Any / Platform Independent

**Features**: Wildcard Matching Support

**Supported OSC types**: i: int32, b: blob, T: true, F: false, N: null
