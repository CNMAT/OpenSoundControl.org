## Multiple-User Shared Musical Control

::: {.content}
A group of human players (not necessarily each skilled musicians) each
interact with an interface (e.g., via a web browser) in real-time to
control some aspect(s) of a single shared sonic environment. This could
be thought of as a client/server model in which multiple clients
interact with a single sound server.\

*Multiple players influence a common synthetic sound output*

Examples:

-   In Randall Packer\'s, Steve Bradley\'s, and John Young\'s
    \"collaborative intermedia work\" *Telemusic \#1* (Young 2001) ,
    visitors to a web site interact with Flash controls that affect
    sound synthesis in a single physical location.
-   In the Tgarden project (see the [f0.am](http://f0.am/tgarden/) or
    [Georgia
    Tech](http://www.gvu.gatech.edu/people/sha.xinwei/topologicalmedia/tgarden/)
    sites) visitors in a space collectively affect the synthesized sound
    indirectly through physical interaction with sensor-equipped objects
    such as special clothing and large balls (as in \"Mapping nonmusical
    data to sound\").
-   [PhopCrop](https://web.archive.org/web/20200929202021/https://www.xdv.org/cgi-bin/twiki/view/Xdv/PhopCrop)
    is a prototype system in which multiple users create and manipulate
    objects in a shared virtual space governed by laws of
    \"pseudophysics.\" Each object has both a graphical and sonic
    representation.
-   [GrenzenloseÂ Freiheit](http://www.grenzenlosefreiheit.de/) is an
    interactive sound installation using OSC with WLAN\'d PDAs as a
    sound control interface for the audience.
