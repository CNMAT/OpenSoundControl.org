## Description

Serpent is a real-time programming language inspired by Python. Serpent currently has a minimal interface to LibLo that provides the ability to create simple OSC servers in Python. A client API has also been defined, but is not yet implemented. The OSC interface was created to allow motion capture data to be sent from an animation program to a Serpent program running as an OSC server and generating music through MIDI.

## Implementation Details

**Platform(s)**: Windows, Linux, Macintosh

**Supported OSC types**: i: int32, s: string, f: float32
