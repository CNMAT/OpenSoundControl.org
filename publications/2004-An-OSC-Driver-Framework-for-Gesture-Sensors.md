**Abstract**: We have developed or integrated a number of gesture sensors over the past few years at CREATE, and have developed a software infrastructure for using them with OSC clients such as CSL and SuperCollider. This poster will outline the reusable software frameworks we use for the sensor server and synthesis client sides of our applications. Example code in C++ will be presented for the sensor-to-OSC and OSC-to-CSL interfaces.

**Context**: This was a featured publication on the legacy (pre-2011) opensoundcontrol.org website, ported to the new site by Matt Wright in early 2021
