  I have developed a camera based motion detectori in C++ under Windows.
  <br>
  First version of the app sent data to its clients via MIDI.
  <br>
  Current version does the same using a proprietary protocol via TCP.
  <br>
  Now I want to move to UDP, and OSC seems a good opportunity to use an open protocolo, instead of implementing another proprietary protocol.
  <br>
  I have two questions:
  <br>
  - Where should start from? Is there an useful online source?
  <br>
  - I'll need to monitor the data sent by my app in OSC form, of course: which readymade application should I try?
  <br>
  Tanks for your attention
