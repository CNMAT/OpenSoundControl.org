**Abstract**:  An on-the-fly reconfigurable low-level embedded service architecture is presented as a means to improve scalability, improve conceptual comprehensibility, reduce human error and reduce development time when designing new sensor-based electronic musical instruments with real-time responsiveness. The implementation of the concept in a project called micro-OSC is described. Other sensor interfacing products are evaluated in the context of DIY prototyping of musical instruments. The capabilities of the micro-OSC platform are demonstrated through a set of examples including  resistive sensing, mixed digital-analog systems, many-channel sensor interfaces and time-based measurement methods. 

**Context**: Adrian Freed kindly provided a parseable collection of OSC-related papers from his website, ported to the new site by Matt Wright in May 2021
