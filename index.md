# OpenSoundControl.org

Welcome to the OpenSoundControl website!  This site documents the 
OpenSoundControl (OSC) specification(s), collects links to related 
publications, and highights a number of hardware and software implementations 
of OSC brought to us by members of our user/developer community.  This site 
is meant as an open forum for sharing and showcasing all things OSC. Users are 
encouraged to contribute by sharing links to documentation of projects and 
artworks that make use of OSC. Please let us know how you are using OSC
by creating an implementation page for your project [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdnHHNzoZ2Qf_gFabpeuNDfAGOWCNMEknDKnDnexRLiUYv7bg/viewform).

#### What is OSC? ####
OpenSoundControl (OSC) is a multi-paradigmatic data transport protocol 
for connecting applications and hardware. OSC was developed by researchers 
Matt Wright and Adrian Freed during their time at the Center for New Music 
& Audio Technologies ([CNMAT](https://cnmat.berkeley.edu)). OSC was originally designed as a highly accurate, 
low latency, flexible method of communication for use in realtime musical 
performance, but has since proven utility across a wide variety of domains. Originally 
intended as a more flexible alternative to the MIDI specification, OSC clears away 
the ideological constraints inherent to MIDI in favor of a user-defined address space 
that can accommodate arbitrary control parameters over a standard networking hardware.

~/OSC/is/Open : "OSC's address space is entirely user-defined, 
thereby allowing it to be both lightweight and endlessly customizable and
extensible to the user's specific needs.  OSC Messages are differentiated 
from one another by a URI-style symbolic naming scheme allowing for 
hierarchical organization of the address space."

~/OSC/is/Accurate : "Open Sound Control messages support a wide variety of
symbolic and high-resolution data types. OSC messages can embed high
resolution time tags for accurate temporal coordination and can be assembled 
into 'bundles' to ensure simultaneous delivery and execution."

~/OSC/is/Flexible: "Open Sound Control includes a pattern matching language
to specify multiple recipients of a single message.  It is designed for maximum
interoperability and thus provides a ready solution for communicating between 
applications and devices, both locally and over a network."
