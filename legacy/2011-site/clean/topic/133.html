  hi,
 </p>
 <p>
  the "Introduction to OSC" page is not really healpful to me. Could someone add some use cases there that illustrate the scope of OSC.
 </p>

  I work one a music composer and add features to control effects externaly (e.g. via joystick). Now I wonder if I could make a ui client on a handheld and offer controls there that can be linked to the effect-parameters on the host. OSC sounds like the right protocol to comunicate. It seems that people have thought about discovering clients via Bonjour/Avahi. Now I wonder it the host (composer) could negotiate needed ui controls with the client (handheld). E.g. suppose I show the mixer on the client, can I tell the client how many channels it needs to show (and give it the labels).
