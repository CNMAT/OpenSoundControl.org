# Is OSC a Protocol?

tl;dr OSC is more of an [encoding](encoding.html) than a protocol.


A true [communication
protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol) would
address the
[semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol#Basic_requirements)
of what the communicated messages *mean*; one aspect of OSC's openness
is that it purposefully leaves semantics completely up to each implementation.
