**Abstract**: We present a novel use of the OpenSound Control (OSC) protocol to represent the output of gestural controllers as well as the input to sound synthesis processes. With this scheme, the problem of mapping gestural input into sound synthesis control becomes a simple translation from OSC messages into other OSC messages. We provide examples of this strategy and show benefits including increased encapsulation and program clarity.

**Context**: This paper describes several CNMAT projects' use of OSC not just as a technical solution to transfer messages among devices but more generally as a way to represent the data at all stages of the transformation from physical measurements of musicians' movement into digitally sculpted sound synthesis. Adrian Freed's 2021 [annotated version](http://opensoundcontrol.org/OSCGestureMapping) adds much more context.
