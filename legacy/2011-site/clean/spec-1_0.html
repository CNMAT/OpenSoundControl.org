 <h2>
  Introduction
 </h2>
 <p>
  Open Sound Control (OSC) is an open, transport-independent, message-based protocol 
  developed for communication among computers, sound synthesizers, and other multimedia 
  devices.
 </p>
 <h2>
  OSC Syntax
 </h2>
 <p>
  This section defines the syntax of OSC data.
 </p>
 <h3>
  Atomic Data Types
 </h3>
 <p>
  All OSC data is composed of the following fundamental data types:
 </p>
 <dl>
  <dt>
   <b>
    int32
   </b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
   32-bit big-endian two's complement integer
  </dd>
  <dt>
   <b>
    OSC-timetag
   </b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
   64-bit big-endian fixed-point time tag, semantics defined below
  </dd>
  <dt>
   <b>
    float32
   </b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
   32-bit big-endian IEEE 754 floating point number
  </dd>
  <dt>
   <b>
    OSC-string
   </b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
   A sequence of non-null ASCII characters followed by a null, followed by 
    0-3 additional null characters to make the total number of bits a multiple 
    of 32. (
   <a href="spec-1_0-examples#OSCstrings">
    OSC-string examples
   </a>
   ) In this 
    document, example OSC-strings will be written without the null characters, 
    surrounded by double quotes.
  </dd>
  <dt>
   <b>
    OSC-blob
   </b>
  </dt>
  <dd>
   An int32 size count, followed by that many 8-bit bytes of arbitrary binary 
    data, followed by 0-3 additional zero bytes to make the total number of bits 
    a multiple of 32.
  </dd>
 </dl>
 <p>
  The size of every atomic data type in OSC is a multiple of 32 bits. This guarantees 
  that if the beginning of a block of OSC data is 32-bit aligned, every number 
  in the OSC data will be 32-bit aligned.
 </p>
 <h3>
  OSC Packets
 </h3>
 <p>
  The unit of transmission of OSC is an
  <i>
   OSC Packet
  </i>
  . Any application that 
  sends OSC Packets is an
  <i>
   OSC Client
  </i>
  ; any application that receives OSC 
  Packets is an
  <i>
   OSC Server
  </i>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  An OSC packet consists of its
  <i>
   contents
  </i>
  , a contiguous block of binary 
  data, and its
  <i>
   size
  </i>
  , the number of 8-bit bytes that comprise the contents. 
  The size of an OSC packet is always a multiple of 4.
 </p>
 <p>
  The underlying network that delivers an OSC packet is responsible for delivering 
  both the contents and the size to the OSC application. An OSC packet can be 
  naturally represented by a datagram by a network protocol such as UDP. In a 
  stream-based protocol such as TCP, the stream should begin with an int32 giving 
  the size of the first packet, followed by the contents of the first packet, 
  followed by the size of the second packet, etc.
 </p>
 <p>
  The contents of an OSC packet must be either an
  <i>
   OSC Message
  </i>
  or an
  <i>
   OSC 
  Bundle
  </i>
  . The first byte of the packet's contents unambiguously distinguishes 
  between these two alternatives.
  <br>
 </p>
 <h3>
  OSC Messages
 </h3>
 <p>
  An OSC message consists of an
  <i>
   OSC Address Pattern
  </i>
  followed by an
  <i>
   OSC 
  Type Tag String
  </i>
  followed by zero or more
  <i>
   OSC Arguments
  </i>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Note: some older implementations of OSC may omit the OSC Type Tag string. Until 
  all such implementations are updated, OSC implementations should be robust in 
  the case of a missing OSC Type Tag String.
 </p>
 <h3>
  OSC Address Patterns
 </h3>
 <p>
  An OSC Address Pattern is an OSC-string beginning with the character '/' (forward 
  slash).
 </p>
 <h3>
  OSC Type Tag String
 </h3>
 <p>
  An OSC Type Tag String is an OSC-string beginning with the character ',' (comma) 
  followed by a sequence of characters corresponding exactly to the sequence of 
  OSC Arguments in the given message. Each character after the comma is called 
  an
  <i>
   OSC Type Tag
  </i>
  and represents the type of the corresponding OSC Argument. 
  (The requirement for OSC Type Tag Strings to start with a comma makes it easier 
  for the recipient of an OSC Message to determine whether that OSC Message is 
  lacking an OSC Type Tag String.)
 </p>
 <p>
  This table lists the correspondance between each OSC Type Tag and the type 
  of its corresponding OSC Argument:

 <p>
  Some OSC applications communicate among instances of themselves with additional, 
  nonstandard argument types beyond those specified above. OSC applications are 
  not required to recognize these types; an OSC application should discard any 
  message whose OSC Type Tag String contains any unrecognized OSC Type Tags. An 
  application that does use any additional argument types must encode them with 
  the OSC Type Tags in this table:

 <h2>
  OSC Semantics
 </h2>
 <p>
  This section defines the semantics of OSC data.
 </p>
 <h3>
  OSC Address Spaces and OSC Addresses
 </h3>
 <p>
  Every OSC server has a set of
  <i>
   OSC Methods
  </i>
  . OSC Methods are the potential 
  destinations of OSC messages received by the OSC server and correspond to each 
  of the points of control that the application makes available. "Invoking" 
  an OSC method is analogous to a procedure call; it means supplying the method 
  with arguments and causing the method's effect to take place.
 </p>
 <p>
  An OSC Server's OSC Methods are arranged in a tree strcuture called an
  <i>
   OSC 
  Address Space
  </i>
  . The leaves of this tree are the OSC Methods and the branch 
  nodes are called
  <i>
   OSC Containers
  </i>
  . An OSC Server's OSC Address Space can 
  be dynamic; that is, its contents and shape can change over time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each OSC Method and each OSC Container other than the root of the tree has 
  a symbolic name, an ASCII string consiting of printable characters other than 
  the following:

 <p>
  The
  <i>
   OSC Address
  </i>
  of an OSC Method is a symbolic name giving the full 
  path to the OSC Method in the OSC Address Space, starting from the root of the 
  tree. An OSC Method's OSC Address begins with the character '/' (forward slash), 
  followed by the names of all the containers, in order, along the path from the 
  root of the tree to the OSC Method, separated by forward slash characters, followed 
  by the name of the OSC Method. The syntax of OSC Addresses was chosen to match 
  the syntax of URLs. (
  <a href="spec-1_0-examples#OSCaddress">
   OSC Address 
  Examples
  </a>
  )
 </p>
 <h3>
  OSC Message Dispatching and Pattern Matching
 </h3>
 <p>
  When an OSC server receives an OSC Message, it must invoke the appropriate 
  OSC Methods in its OSC Address Space based on the OSC Message's OSC Address 
  Pattern. This process is called
  <i>
   dispatching
  </i>
  the OSC Message to the OSC 
  Methods that
  <i>
   match
  </i>
  its OSC Address Pattern. All the matching OSC Methods 
  are invoked with the same argument data, namely, the OSC Arguments in the OSC 
  Message.
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <i>
   parts
  </i>
  of an OSC Address or an OSC Address Pattern are the substrings 
  between adjacent pairs of forward slash characters and the substring after the 
  last forward slash character. (
  <a href="spec-1_0-examples#addressparts">
   examples
  </a>
  )
 </p>
 <p>
  A received OSC Message must be disptched to every OSC method in the current 
  OSC Address Space whose OSC Address matches the OSC Message's OSC Address Pattern. 
  An OSC Address Pattern matches an OSC Address if
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   The OSC Address and the OSC Address Pattern contain the same number of parts; 
    and
  </li>
  <li>
   Each part of the OSC Address Pattern matches the corresponding part of the 
    OSC Address.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  A part of an OSC Address Pattern matches a part of an OSC Address if every 
  consecutive character in the OSC Address Pattern matches the next consecutive 
  substring of the OSC Address and every character in the OSC Address is matched 
  by something in the OSC Address Pattern. These are the matching rules for characters 
  in the OSC Address Pattern:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   '?' in the OSC Address Pattern matches any single character
  </li>
  <li>
   '*' in the OSC Address Pattern matches any sequence of zero or more characters
  </li>
  <li>
   A string of characters in square brackets (e.g., "[string]") in 
    the OSC Address Pattern matches any character in the string. Inside square 
    brackets, the minus sign (-) and exclamation point (!) have special meanings:
   <ul>
    <li>
     two characters separated by a minus sign indicate the range of characters 
        between the given two in ASCII collating sequence. (A minus sign at the 
        end of the string has no special meaning.)
    </li>
    <li>
     An exclamation point at the beginning of a bracketed string negates 
        the sense of the list, meaning that the list matches any character not 
        in the list. (An exclamation point anywhere besides the first character 
        after the open bracket has no special meaning.)
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   A comma-separated list of strings enclosed in curly braces (e.g., "{foo,bar}") 
    in the OSC Address Pattern matches any of the strings in the list.
  </li>
  <li>
   Any other character in an OSC Address Pattern can match only the same character.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <h3>
  <a name="timetags">
  </a>
  Temporal Semantics and OSC Time Tags
 </h3>
 <p>
  An OSC server must have access to a representation of the correct current absolute 
  time. OSC does not provide any mechanism for clock synchronization.
 </p>
 <p>
  When a received OSC Packet contains only a single OSC Message, the OSC Server 
  should invoke the correponding OSC Methods immediately, i.e., as soon as possible 
  after receipt of the packet. Otherwise a received OSC Packet contains an OSC 
  Bundle, in which case the OSC Bundle's OSC Time Tag determines when the OSC 
  Bundle's OSC Messages' corresponding OSC Methods should be invoked. If the time 
  represented by the OSC Time Tag is before or equal to the current time, the 
  OSC Server should invoke the methods immediately (unless the user has configured 
  the OSC Server to discard messages that arrive too late). Otherwise the OSC 
  Time Tag represents a time in the future, and the OSC server must store the 
  OSC Bundle until the specified time and then invoke the appropriate OSC Methods.
 </p>
 <p>
  Time tags are represented by a 64 bit fixed point number. The first 32 bits 
  specify the number of seconds since midnight on January 1, 1900, and the last 
  32 bits specify fractional parts of a second to a precision of about 200 picoseconds. 
  This is the representation used by Internet NTP timestamps.The time tag value 
  consisting of 63 zero bits followed by a one in the least signifigant bit is 
  a special case meaning "immediately."
 </p>
 <p>
  OSC Messages in the same OSC Bundle are
  <i>
   atomic
  </i>
  ; their corresponding 
  OSC Methods should be invoked in immediate succession as if no other processing 
  took place between the OSC Method invocations.
 </p>
 <p>
  When an OSC Address Pattern is dispatched to multiple OSC Methods, the order 
  in which the matching OSC Methods are invoked is unspecified. When an OSC Bundle 
  contains multiple OSC Messages, the sets of OSC Methods corresponding to the 
  OSC Messages must be invoked in the same order as the OSC Messages appear in 
  the packet. (
  <a href="spec-1_0-examples.html#bundledispatchorder">
   example
  </a>
  )
 </p>
 <p>
  When bundles contain other bundles, the OSC Time Tag of the enclosed bundle 
  must be greater than or equal to the OSC Time Tag of the enclosing bundle. The 
  atomicity requirement for OSC Messages in the same OSC Bundle does not apply 
  to OSC Bundles within an OSC Bundle.
