Hello Everybody, I\'am new to audio processing and it is very wonderful
what is possible to do with osc and Max.

I have to write an application in java that send control to a max/msp
application, I downlaod the osc and configure everything but I don\'t
understand the message specification, When ever I send a message from
java to msp, I receive this error message.

net.recv.udp: OSC Bad message name string: DataAfterAlignedString: Unreasonably long string Dropping entire message. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Can anyone help me???

The .pat file contains an udpread object and a print object.\
Thanks
