## Description

I'm working as sound technician and programmer and I developed this application for own and particular use. I'm using this prototype successfully in Live Music Shows. <p> My "server" application is multiplatform (pc, linux and mac) and "client" application can be installed on touch and multitouch devices (pda, tablet pc, touch screens, iphone, etc.) <p> I'm using OSC for comunicating clients and server. OSC is powerful and easy to manage. <p> I'm trying to use OSC for audio streaming between server and client but I has not had success with this issue. If someone can help me it will be very appreciated. Thanks a lot in advance.
