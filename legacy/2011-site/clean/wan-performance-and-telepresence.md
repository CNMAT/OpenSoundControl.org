A group of musicians in different physical locations play together as a
sort of \"musical conference call\". Control messages and/or audio from
each player go out to all the other sites. Sound is produced at each
site to represent the activities of each participant.\
Examples:

-   The Hub\'s projects (Chris Brown, Mike Berry, Grainwave\...)
-   [Quintet.net](http://www.quintet.net/)
-   Randall Packer\'s projects
