## Description

OSCgroups is a system for routing OSC messages between a group of collaborating users. It is designed to make joining and leaving a group simple, and to overcome the problem of connecting multiple users behind different NAT routers on the Internet. OSCgroups also implements basic group functionality similar to the concept of channels in internet relay chat.
